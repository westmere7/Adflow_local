        <p>Adflow is a professional visual design tool engineered specifically for building animated HTML5 display ads. Lay out your entire banner size set side-by-side on an infinite workspace, coordinate them with Link Groups, merge spreadsheet version rows to generate dozens of creative variants, and export standards-compliant ZIP packages in a single click.</p>
        <p>Adflow cuts out the heavy installation requirements and complex build pipelines of legacy applications, allowing creative teams to work with no account, keep projects as portable .flow files, and audit ad package weights before publication.</p>
        <p style="color:var(--text-muted); font-weight: 500;">Two core concepts to get started with:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Multi-Canvas & Link Groups</b>: Lay out all dimensions side-by-side in one workspace. Editing a text string or changing a border style on one canvas propagates the update to all other formats automatically when Live-Link is active.</li>
          <li><b>Auto-Resize Placement</b>: Design one canvas format, then automatically generate and scale the layout across tall, wide, and square canvas dimensions using a rule-based placement engine.</li>
        </ul>
        <div style="font-size: 11.5px; color: var(--text-muted); opacity: 0.8; border-top: 1px solid var(--border-light); padding-top: 8px; margin-top: 16px;"><b>General Tips:</b> We recommend designing your source layout in a 300×250 canvas because its proportions adapt naturally to other ratios. Run Auto-Resize to generate the other dimensions, and check the grey and purple role tags in the Layers panel to adjust layout behavior.</div>
      `},
      { id: 'features-list', title: 'Powerful Features', body: `
        <p>Adflow comes packed with a comprehensive, professional feature set designed to optimize and accelerate banner production workflows:</p>
        <ul style="line-height: 1.6; padding-left: 20px; margin-top: 12px; margin-bottom: 12px;">
          <li style="margin-bottom: 8px;"><b>Multi-Canvas Workspace</b>: Layout and edit all standard and custom size formats side-by-side on an infinite panning workspace. No more jumping between file tabs.</li>
          <li style="margin-bottom: 8px;"><b>Deterministic Auto-Resize</b>: Build one format, and automatically generate your entire size set. The engine uses a 9-role heuristics taxonomy to reposition and wrap copy automatically.</li>
          <li style="margin-bottom: 8px;"><b>Live-Link Groups</b>: Bidirectionally sync copy, styles, typography, and background treatments across canvases in real-time, or choose specific properties to sync/unlink.</li>
          <li style="margin-bottom: 8px;"><b>Spreadsheet Data Merge</b>: Build version sheets inline or upload CSV files. Map column headers directly to dynamic slot-bound canvas layers to auto-generate version variations.</li>
          <li style="margin-bottom: 8px;"><b>Frame-Based Animations</b>: Sequence multi-frame banners and apply entering transitions, exits or Animation FX presets without manual keyframing complexity.</li>
          <li style="margin-bottom: 8px;"><b>Drag-to-Retime Timeline</b>: A sequencer along the bottom of the workspace shows every layer's IN, OUT and FX spans as bars you can drag, resize, and retime several layers at a time — with a Play button that replays the frame using the exported ad's own animation code.</li>
          <li style="margin-bottom: 8px;"><b>Built-in Image Compressor</b>: Compress and convert JPEG/PNG assets to WebP, JPEG, or PNG depending on project configuration to meet strict ad network weight targets (150 KB standard).</li>
          <li style="margin-bottom: 8px;"><b>Layer-Based Vector Masking</b>: Use any vector shape layer (rectangles, circles, custom brand SVG pixels) to non-destructively mask images below using clean CSS clip-path logic.</li>
          <li style="margin-bottom: 8px;"><b>Fully Local, No Accounts</b>: Nothing to sign in to and nothing uploaded. Work autosaves locally, travels as portable <code>.flow</code> files, and the whole app runs as a desktop build, from a static host, or from a single Docker container — with no internet access required.</li>
          <li style="margin-bottom: 8px;"><b>Pre-Flight Audit & Export</b>: Package ready-to-run compliant ZIP bundles. Adflow validates clicktags and asset constraints automatically.</li>
          <li style="margin-bottom: 8px;"><b>Batch Operation Portal</b>: Hand a template to another team and let them produce the whole pack themselves — open template, import data sheet, export every version, in three steps and no editor knowledge.</li>
          <li style="margin-bottom: 8px;"><b>Preview Portal</b>: A dedicated review page for stepping through every size, frame and data version — and for playing up to 10 standalone HTML5 ads built outside Adflow side by side.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Instead of opening one file per banner size, Adflow shows every canvas (300×250, 728×90, 160×600, …) side-by-side on an infinite workspace. You pan with <span class="kbd">Space</span>+drag, zoom with the scroll wheel.</p>
        <p>The win: when you edit a headline on the 728×90, you don't repeat the edit on the other 5 sizes. <b>Link Groups</b> bind siblings across canvases — a change on one propagates to all of them (immediately if Live-link is on, on demand otherwise).</p>

        <ul>

        <p>Adflow's Workspace is an infinite, multi-canvas panning board designed to host and organize your entire display ad set side-by-side. Instead of treating each ad size as a separate project file, this workspace maps all canvases onto a single layout viewport, letting you pan with <span class="kbd">Space</span>+drag and scroll with the wheel to zoom.</p>
        <p>The workspace comes equipped with precision alignment guides, coordinate rules, and real-time bounding safezone overlays. These layout aids guarantee that creative components adhere strictly to legal requirements and visual guidelines across both landscape and portrait dimensions.</p>
        <p>Along the bottom sits the <a href="#" data-doc-sec="animation" data-doc-sub="timeline" style="color:var(--text-accent); font-weight: 500;">Timeline</a> — a collapsible sequencer showing the active frame's animations as draggable bars. Click its header to expand or collapse it; the choice is remembered.</p>
        <p><b>Adflow's Advantage:</b> In legacy visual editors, adjusting different banner aspect ratios requires opening multiple application tabs, leading to mismatched copy and inconsistent layouts. Adflow places every target canvas side-by-side, allowing creative teams to verify layout alignments, compare formats, and coordinate updates instantly across the entire campaign.</p>
        <div style="font-size: 11.5px; color: var(--text-muted); opacity: 0.8; border-top: 1px solid var(--border-light); padding-top: 8px; margin-top: 16px;"><b>General Tips:</b> Use custom horizontal and vertical guides by dragging directly from the viewport rulers onto a focused canvas.

        <p>Designing elements in Adflow enables you to construct layout layers using a combination of text blocks, call-to-action buttons, vector shapes, pre-approved brand graphics, and compressed raster image layers. Each element's style, fill, stroke, rotation, and opacity can be adjusted inside the right-hand Properties panel.</p>
        <p>Adflow includes a pre-loaded library of approved brand elements, such as logo marks and compliance components, which can be placed instantly onto any focused canvas. Additionally, the workspace includes custom utilities like a non-destructive Crop & Level tool and layer-based image masking to support custom framing workflows.</p>
        <p><b>Adflow's Advantage:</b> Standard layout editors require tedious manual asset management and yield bloated output packages. Adflow bundles assets natively, optimizes text measurements automatically, and includes an active multi-format image compressor to convert and downsize files directly in the browser to fit network weight limits.</p>
        <div style="font-size: 11.5px; color: var(--text-muted); opacity: 0.8; border-top: 1px solid var(--border-light); padding-top: 8px; margin-top: 16px;"><b>General Tips:</b> Save customized layers or group templates directly into the Assets panel to reuse them across other projects. When cropping uploaded graphics, use the Crop & Level slider: the rotation is baked directly into the output crop image, which leaves the layer's primary transform handles clean and aligned.</div>

        <p><b>Replacing a picture.</b> Three ways, all equivalent:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Drop onto the image on the canvas</b> — works on a masked photo too; Adflow looks through the mask shape to the image beneath, leaving the mask's shape and position untouched.</li>
          <li><b>Drop onto the preview thumbnail</b> in the Properties panel — drag a file from your computer or an image out of the Assets panel. The preview shows a dashed frame and a <i>Drop to replace image</i> label while you're over it. This is the route to use when a mask group is selected, since the panel already targets the masked image.</li>
          <li><b>Click the preview</b> (or <b>Browse…</b>) to pick a file.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>All three behave identically: a picture bound to a data column updates the <b>active version's cell</b> rather than the template default, the <b>Data lock</b> is respected, the fixed RMIT logo can't be swapped, and a live-linked group propagates the new picture to its siblings (with Live-link off, use <b>Push changes to group</b>).</p>
        <p><b>Image compression:</b> Adflow includes a built-in multi-format compressor for PNG/JPEG uploads, supporting WebP, JPEG, or PNG formats depending on Project Settings and image transparency. Features a quality slider (10–100%) and live KB preview to help you stay under the ad weight limit.</p>

        <p>Rectangles, circles, and lines from the Add panel. Adjust fill, stroke, corner radius from the Properties panel.</p>
        <p><b>Image Masking:</b> Right-click a shape layer (rectangle, circle, or pixel) and select <b>Use as Mask</b> to clip the image directly beneath it. The mask constraint validates automatically — if the masked image is deleted or moved, the mask safely reverts to a normal shape layer.</p>
      `},
      { id: 'advanced-masking', title: 'Advanced Masking Engine', body: `
        <p>The image masking system is extremely robust and natively mirrored in the HTML5 exporter.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Independent Animation:</b> Mask shapes carry their own independent entry transitions and effects separate from the image they mask. Hovering animation presets previews the mask or image accurately.</li>
          <li><b>Layer Prefixes:</b> Mask layers display a <span style="color: var(--text-accent);">[mask]</span> prefix, and target images display a <span style="color: var(--text-accent); opacity: 0.7;">[masked]</span> prefix in the Layers panel.</li>
          <li><b>Mask layers can be link-grouped:</b> right-click a mask and use <b>Link Group</b> exactly as you would for any shape, so a mask's animation and corner radius can follow across every size. <b>Transform is off by default</b> for masks — a mask's size belongs to the image it clips on its own canvas, and Auto-Resize realigns it there, so copying one canvas's dimensions onto the rest would distort the clip. Tick it in the Link Groups panel if you do want sizes locked together. Auto-Link pairs masks with masks only, never with an ordinary shape that happens to share a name.</li>
          <li><b>Linking the whole pair:</b> select the mask group (mask + its image) and use <b>Auto-Link</b> or <b>Create New Group…</b>. Since a link group holds one kind of layer, the pair becomes <b>two parallel groups</b> — one for the images, one for the masks — created together and named <i>"&lt;name&gt; (Image)"</i> and <i>"&lt;name&gt; (Mask)"</i>. <b>Live Linking</b>, <b>Push Changes</b> and <b>Remove Link</b> then act on both at once. Transform stays off on both halves, so the mask can never end up sized for a different banner than the picture it clips.</li>
          <li><b>No Dynamic Data:</b> a mask is a shape, not a content slot, so the Dynamic Data panel stays disabled while a layer is a mask — turn <b>Use as mask</b> off to bind data to it.</li>
          <li><b>Swap the Photo Without Unmasking:</b> Drop an image file from your computer, or drag one out of the Assets panel, straight onto the masked photo — Adflow looks through the mask shape to the image beneath and replaces just the photo. The mask's shape, position and size are untouched, so there's no need to unmask, swap and re-apply. Dragging another image already on the canvas onto it does the same.</li>

Saved gradients sit in their own row above it. Both are stored on the project and travel with the <code>.flow</code> file, so a project opens with the palette it was built with.</p>
        <p><b>Everywhere means everywhere.</b> Every colour control in Adflow opens this picker — element fills and strokes, text and button colours, canvas background, <b>File → New Project</b>'s default background, and <b>File → Settings → Default Canvas Background</b>. None of them fall back to the browser's own colour dialog, which has no palette, no gradients and doesn't follow your theme.

        <p>Adflow's Animation suite sequences multi-frame narratives and applies entering transitions or Animation FX motion to layout layers. You can define sequential frames with distinct durations, adjust frame entrance styles, and apply staggered delays to establish visual pacing.</p>
        <p>Animations are split into four independent categories, each with its own on/off toggle in the Animation panel header: <b>IN</b> (entrance, plays once as the frame appears), <b>OUT</b> (exit, plays at the end of the element's time on the frame), <b>FX</b> (Animation FX, which run continuously while the frame is active), and <b>TRANS</b> (the frame's own entering transition). Turning a category off remembers its settings, so switching it back on restores exactly what you had.</p>
        <p>The <b>Timeline</b> panel at the bottom of the workspace shows all three per-element categories as draggable bars, so you can retime an entrance, an exit and an effect by eye instead of typing numbers into the panel. Both surfaces edit the same values — use whichever is quicker.</p>
        <p><b>Adflow's Advantage:</b> Legacy animation tools force designers to construct complex keyframe timelines for every single canvas element. Adflow abstracts this complexity: you can apply transitions like swipes, slides, or zooms, and configure Animation FX like floating, pulsing, or typing using simple dropdown presets — then fine-tune the timing on the timeline.</p>

Toggle the 'Skip Frame' check to test specific portions of your frame sequence in isolation.</div>

        <p><b>Single-frame loops:</b> a one-frame ad with Loop on still re-animates — the exported runtime restarts the frame each cycle, replaying every entrance (and the frame transition, if you set one). Useful for animated email signatures and similar always-on placements.</p>
        <p><b>Deleting a frame</b> (the <b>−</b> button, in the top bar or under any canvas) takes that frame's layers with it. Frames are project-wide, so this happens on <i>every</i> canvas at once — if you'd lose anything, Adflow asks first and tells you how many layers on how many canvases. Layers set to Always Top or Always Bottom survive, because they belong to every frame rather than to one. A frame with nothing of its own is removed without a prompt, and any deletion can be undone.</p>

Open it from the ⟳ button in the Layers panel header, or right-click the canvas → <b>Distribute / Sync → Across Frames…</b> — the two tabs of that one panel are the two directions layers can travel.</p>
        <p>Pick the <b>Source Frame</b> at the top; the canvas jumps to it as you choose, so you can see what you're about to copy. Only that frame's own layers travel — Always Top and Always Bottom layers already appear on every frame, so copying them would just duplicate them. <b>Stack order always comes across</b>, because this copies rather than rearranges.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Carry Over</b> — <b>Visibility State</b> and <b>Lock State</b> bring each layer's hidden/locked flags along; switch either off and the copies arrive visible or unlocked. <b>Manual Role Assignments</b> carries a role you set by hand; automatic roles are worked out afresh from the layer either way, so this only matters for roles you've overridden.</li>
          <li><b>Break Link Group</b> — on by default, and worth leaving on. Link groups pair a layer with its counterparts on <i>other canvases</i>, which normally hold the same content; frames normally hold different content. Leaving it off means the copy joins the source's group, so a group ends up with two members on one canvas.</li>
          <li><b>Replace existing layers</b> — on by default. Each target frame is emptied first, so it ends up matching the source exactly and re-running the sync changes nothing the second time. Switch it off to keep what's already in those frames: the copies land <i>on top of</i> the existing layers, inside their own tier. Handy for building several frames from a shared base — but running it again then stacks another copy on top.</li>
          <li><b>Target Frames</b> — all other frames, or tick individual ones. A frame is never copied onto itself.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The confirmation names the real numbers — <i>"Copied 3 layers to 2 frames, replacing 2 existing layers"</i> — and tells you when there was nothing to copy. The whole operation is one undo step.</p>
      `},
      { id: 'timeline', title: 'Timeline (sequencer)', body: `
        <p>The <b>Timeline</b> sits along the bottom of the workspace and lays out the animations of the <b>active canvas and frame</b>. Click its header bar to expand or collapse it — the state is remembered between sessions. The header also shows which canvas and frame you're looking at, the frame's duration, and the current grid step.</p>
        <p>Each row is one layer, ordered like the Layers panel (topmost first). By default only layers that actually have an animation get a row; switch on <b>Show all elements</b> in the timeline's ⚙ settings to list everything on the frame.</p>
        <p><b>The three bars.</b> Every row's track can show up to three bars, all on the same time axis:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>IN</b> — the entrance. Its position is the animation's delay; its length is its duration.</li>
          <li><b>OUT</b> — the exit. It starts after the element appears, so moving the IN bar carries the OUT bar with it.</li>
          <li><b>FX</b> — the Animation FX span, drawn as white diagonal stripes across the row's full height so it stays readable even where it sits under IN or OUT. The stripes drift slowly on the selected layer only. An FX effect set to loop forever runs to the end of the track.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Editing.</b> Drag a bar to move it, or drag either edge to retime it. A tooltip follows the pointer showing the exact start → end while you drag. Everything snaps to the grid step (0.1s by default), and every edit is a normal undoable change that propagates through Link Groups exactly as the Animation panel's own fields do.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Presets:</b> click a row's <b>IN</b>, <b>OUT</b> or <b>FX</b> chip to pick a preset — the same lists the Animation panel offers, with the same hover-to-preview. Picking a real preset also switches that category on. OUT is unavailable until IN is enabled.</li>
          <li><b>Several layers at once:</b> multi-select rows (<span class="kbd">Ctrl</span> to add, <span class="kbd">Shift</span> for a range), then drag any one of their bars — every selected layer moves or resizes by the same amount, and the drag is clamped so no layer crosses zero.</li>
          <li><b>Row order:</b> drag a row label to reorder rows. This affects the timeline's display only, not the layer stack.</li>
          <li><b>Hover:</b> hovering a row outlines that element on the canvas, so you can tell which bar belongs to what.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>FX edit mode (isolating an FX bar).</b> Because an FX span often lies underneath the IN and OUT bars, a thin strip along the bottom of the FX bar stays grabbable at all times — so you can drag FX anywhere along its length even where those bars cover it. <b>Click</b> that strip on a layer that is already selected to <b>isolate</b> the FX bar, the timeline's equivalent of stepping inside a group on the canvas: the IN and OUT bars fade back and stop responding, and the whole FX bar becomes draggable with resize handles of its own. Press <span class="kbd">Esc</span> or click anywhere else to leave. IN and OUT stay fully grabbable whenever no FX bar is isolated, and the row's chips keep working while one is.</p>
        <p><b>Play.</b> The <b>▶ Play</b> button (or tapping <span class="kbd">Space</span>) replays the current frame's animations in place on the editor canvas, using the very same animation code the export generates — so what you see is what ships. It deliberately does not advance to the next frame; use the full Preview for that.</p>
        <p><b>Frame duration follows the animations.</b> If you drag an animation past the end of the frame, the frame's duration extends to fit and a notice tells you. Pull it back in and the duration shrinks again, but never below whatever it was before the timeline extended it. The stretch of track beyond the frame's end is shaded so you can see when you're over.</p>
        <p><b>Settings (⚙).</b> Choose the grid step (0.1s – 0.5s) and toggle <b>Show all elements</b>. Moving to a <i>coarser</i> grid re-snaps every animation timing on the current canvas and frame, so Adflow asks first.</p>
      `},
      { id: 'previewing', title: 'Previewing your ad', body: `
        <p>There are three ways to watch an ad play, in ascending order of fidelity to what actually ships.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Timeline ▶ Play</b> (or <span class="kbd">Space</span>) — replays the <i>current frame</i> of the <i>active canvas</i>, in place on the editor canvas. Fast, and it stays inside one frame; it never advances to the next.</li>
          <li><b>Hover preview</b> — the small toggle joined to the right of <b>Full preview</b>. Switch it on, then simply point at <b>Full preview</b> and every canvas starts playing at once, immediately, through the whole frame sequence. Point away and the editor canvases come back. The same toggle also governs the <b>Version</b> dropdowns: armed, pointing at a row renders that version across the board so you can flick through them; switched off, versions only change when you click one.</li>
          <li><b>Full preview</b> — clicking the button. Hides the panels, zooms to fit every canvas, and gives you the preview control bar (frame selector, Replay all, Download all, data-version stepper). <span class="kbd">Esc</span> returns you to exactly the view you left.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Hover preview in detail.</b> It builds the same iframes full preview and the exported ad use, so it is not an approximation — animations, frame transitions, durations, loop behaviour and data-merge content are all the real thing. What it deliberately does <i>not</i> do is move anything: your zoom, scroll position, panels, timeline and selection all stay exactly where they are, and it never goes fullscreen. That makes it the quickest way to check timing across every size without losing your place on the board — useful when you're iterating on one animation and want to see its effect on all sizes between edits.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Pointing at the <b>toggle itself</b> never starts a preview — only the Full preview button does.</li>
          <li>It reaches the <b>Version</b> dropdown wherever that dropdown appears — the toolbar switcher while you're editing, and the floating bar in single-canvas and full preview. Turning the toggle off mid-hover restores the version you were on.</li>
          <li>Because the top bar is hidden while you preview, the floating bar carries its <b>own copy of the toggle</b> beside the version arrows. It is the same switch: flipping either updates both.</li>
          <li>Clicking <b>Full preview</b> while a hover preview is running still opens the real full preview as normal.</li>
          <li>It stands down automatically if you press a key or switch tabs, and it won't start mid-drag, while you're editing text, or when you're already in a preview.</li>
          <li>The toggle remembers whether it's armed between sessions.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Beyond these, the <b>Preview Portal</b> is a separate page for sharing a review surface with people who don't use the editor — see <a href="#" data-doc-sec="portals" data-doc-sub="preview-portal" style="color:var(--text-accent); font-weight: 500;">Portals</a>.</p>
      `},
      { id: 'frame-transitions', title: 'Frame transitions', body: `
        <p>Set how each frame enters: <b>Fade</b>, <b>Slide</b> (4 directions), <b>Swipe</b> (4 directions — a directional wipe that reveals the next frame), <b>Zoom in</b> / <b>Zoom out</b>. Slide and Swipe also offer an <b>Add Fade</b> toggle and adjustable duration.</p>
        <p>A transition can play on any frame that something actually enters from: a later frame, or <i>any</i> frame — including a lone single frame — when Loop is on. It is greyed out only for a single static frame with Loop off.</p>
      `},
      { id: 'entrance-animations', title: 'Entrance animations', body: `
        <p>Per-element IN animations play when a frame begins: <b>Fade In</b>, <b>Slide</b>, <b>Swipe</b>, <b>Zoom</b>, <b>Split</b>, <b>Blur</b>, plus three text-only presets — <b>Typing</b>, <b>Pop</b> and <b>Reveal</b>. Each has a duration and delay, and preset-specific settings (direction, blur radius, an added fade, and so on). Stagger the delays to build a sequence rather than animating everything at once.</p>
        <p>The text-only presets break the copy into pieces and animate them in turn:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Typing</b> — <b>Type by</b> Letters or Words, with an optional <b>Fade</b>. Four looks in one preset: characters fading in, characters snapping in like a typewriter, whole words fading in, or words snapping in. At small sizes prefer <b>Words</b> — letter-by-letter often reads slower than a banner has time for.</li>
          <li><b>Pop</b> — units scale up into place on an overshoot curve, arriving as distinct beats. <b>Pop by</b> Words or Lines (no Letters — per-character overshoot is too busy to read). Strong on short headlines and CTAs.</li>
          <li><b>Reveal</b> — each unit travels out from behind a mask. <b>Reveal by</b> letters, words or visual lines, and <b>From</b> Below, Above, Left or Right — Left and Right make it a lateral wipe rather than a rise. Optional <b>Fade</b> softens the reveal.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Line mode is the one to reach for when copy varies.</b> Visual lines only exist after layout, so Adflow measures where each word actually landed and staggers by real line — which means the grouping re-derives itself whenever text re-wraps at a different banner size or from a different data-merge row.</p>
        <p>Because all of these are driven by that split markup, they preview, play on the timeline, and export through exactly the same builder, so all three surfaces look identical. Each one's stagger is normalised to its total duration, so a short row and a long row from the same data sheet both finish on time.</p>
        <p>The same preset list appears in the Animation panel and in the timeline's IN chip; they read from one shared registry, so a preset can never appear in one place and not the other.</p>
      `},
      { id: 'exit-animations', title: 'Exit animations', body: `
        <p>Per-element OUT animations play at the end of the element's active time on a frame: <b>Fade Out</b>, <b>Slide</b>, <b>Swipe</b>, <b>Zoom</b>, <b>Blur</b>, plus two text-only exits that mirror the text entrances:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Untype</b> — removes the line the way it arrived, one character or one word at a time (following the entrance's <b>Type by</b> setting), running <i>backwards from the end</i> so it reads like backspacing. It needs an entrance that arrives piece by piece — <b>Typing</b>, <b>Pop</b> or <b>Reveal</b> — since it works by taking those pieces away again.</li>
          <li><b>Unreveal</b> — tucks each unit back behind its mask, leaving by the same edge it entered from, so a line that wiped in from the left wipes back out to the left. It requires <b>Reveal</b> as the entrance, since it travels into the mask Reveal builds — it isn't offered otherwise, and if you change the entrance later the exit falls back to Fade Out rather than doing nothing.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Slide</b> and <b>Zoom</b> always fade — they have no Fade option, because neither travels far enough to leave on its own (Slide shifts by its distance setting, Zoom shrinks to 80%), so without the fade the layer would never actually exit. <b>Swipe</b> and <b>Blur</b> do keep a Fade option, since both clear the layer on their own.</p>
        <p>The exit starts after the configured <b>after</b> delay. That timer automatically includes the entrance (IN) delay, so the element stays fully visible for the time you specify, counted from when it actually appears rather than from the start of the frame.</p>
        <p>OUT requires IN to be enabled — an element with no entrance can't have an exit. Exits don't apply to persistent (Always Top / Always Bottom) layers, which never leave. Sync OUT across a Link Group with the group's <b>OUT Animation</b> property.</p>
      `},
      { id: 'continuous-effects', title: 'Animation FX', body: `
        <p>Animation FX are looping, non-destructive effects that overlay on top of the frame state: <b>Pulse</b>, <b>Float</b>, <b>Flash</b>, <b>Wiggle</b>, <b>Spin</b>, <b>Heartbeat</b>, <b>Move</b>, <b>Zoom</b>, <b>Underline</b>. Toggle <b>Perform once</b> to play a single cycle instead of looping.</p>
        <p><b>Underline</b> is the odd one out: instead of moving the layer it paints on it, wiping a rule in beneath the words, holding it, then wiping it out the far side. The rule is drawn on the type itself, so it is only as wide as the words and sits directly under them rather than stretching across the layer box — and wrapped copy gets one underline per line, each the width of its own line. Settings are Thickness, Colour and an Offset that lifts the rule off the baseline. Text and buttons only; elsewhere there is no type for it to hug. Note that a text layer with <b>BG</b> switched on will cover the rule.</p>
        <p>On a masked image the effect is applied to the mask wrapper while the image beneath receives the inverse motion, which keeps the photo itself stationary inside a moving mask.</p>
        <p>Set the FX delay and duration numerically in the Animation panel, or drag the striped FX bar on the <a href="#" data-doc-sec="animation" data-doc-sub="timeline" style="color:var(--text-accent); font-weight: 500;">Timeline</a>.</p>

        <p>Link Groups associate matching elements across canvases, synchronising their contents and design properties in real time. Rather than repeating edits, modifying a linked layer's properties immediately propagates the change to all group members across the campaign.</p>
        <p>Adflow provides granular synchronization checkboxes for each group. You can choose to lock text content, colors, borders, and animations together while keeping layout transforms (like coordinates and bounding widths) independent to suit each format's proportions.</p>
        <p><b>Adflow's Advantage:</b> When copy edits or style changes occur during creative reviews, designers usually have to update each banner size individually. Adflow's Live-Link mode syncs all sibling elements instantly in the background, cutting manual layout repetition down to zero.</p>

        <p><b>Distribute</b> copies layers from the canvas you're working on to every other canvas, on the frame you're looking at. It's how a layout you've built at one size gets to all the others.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Some layers</b> — select them, right-click, <b>Distribute</b>.</li>
          <li><b>The whole frame</b> — right-click the canvas and choose <b>Distribute / Sync → Across Canvases…</b>, which opens the panel on its own tab. No selecting required, and you can set the options and pick which canvases to send to before running it.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>The arrangement travels with it, resized to fit.</b> The selection moves as one piece and is scaled by the ratio of the two canvases' diagonals, so a layout built at 300&times;250 arrives smaller on a leaderboard and larger on a skyscraper. One factor drives positions, sizes, font sizes and the gaps between layers, so aspect ratios and the arrangement are preserved exactly, and the composition is centred on each target. Nothing is ever left off-canvas: the factor is capped so the layout fits, and anything that would still sit outside is pulled back in — element groups moving as one so their internal composition is never disturbed. Stacking order comes across too, so the copies sit in the same order as the source. Nudging them into place on each size afterwards is expected — the point is that you're adjusting a layout rather than rebuilding one.</p>
        <p><b>What gets replaced.</b> If a target canvas already holds a layer that corresponds to one you're sending — same link group, or failing that the same name and type — that layer is replaced. Anything else on that canvas is left exactly as it was. When something is going to be replaced, Adflow tells you what and how many before it does it, and the whole thing is a single undo step.</p>
        <p><b>From the canvas menu, Always Top and Always Bottom layers stay put.</b> They already appear on every frame, and they're usually brand furniture positioned to suit each banner's shape — recentring the RMIT logo as part of a composition would move it on every size at once. Distribute them deliberately by selecting them if you need to.</p>

        <h4 style="margin: 16px 0 6px; font-size: 12px; color: var(--text-bright);">Distribute &amp; Link</h4>
        <p>Same copy, and then each layer is linked to its counterpart on every canvas — so editing the headline on one size updates it everywhere, per the group's <a href="#" data-doc-sec="link-groups" data-doc-sub="sync-properties" style="color:var(--text-accent); font-weight: 500;">sync properties</a>. This is the normal way to start a multi-size project: build one size, Distribute &amp; Link, then adjust each canvas.</p>
        <p>Plain <b>Distribute</b> never adds or removes a link group. If it replaces a layer that was in one, the copy takes over that membership, so a canvas can't quietly drop out of a group it already belonged to.</p>

        <p>Adflow's Data & Versions panel supports Dynamic Creative Optimization (DCO). Rather than manually copy-pasting different layout configurations for multiple course names, campuses, or call-to-actions, you bind specific fields to a spreadsheet column, allowing you to feed multiple data variants into a single template design.</p>
        <p>You can import external CSV sheets or construct version rows inside the editor. Each row in your dataset represents a distinct version, which you can live-preview across all canvas formats simultaneously using the top-bar dropdown.

        <p>Saving & Projects regulates local autosaves, portable project archives, and startup state restorations. Adflow uses a local-first architecture, saving every action locally in the background to ensure no creative updates are lost due to browser crashes or network dropouts.</p>
        <p>Projects are saved using the custom <code>.flow</code> format. The file is a compressed ZIP archive containing all project layout structures and binary assets. It can be stored locally or pushed to team cloud folders, and travels as a single self-contained package.</p>
        <p><b>Adflow's Advantage:</b> Legacy design software often requires manual saving and generates fragmented local project folders. Adflow manages autosaves in the background (persisting canvas scroll, zoom level, and history stack) and provides a history limit of up to 50 states.</p>

        <p>The Export dialog's <b>Format</b> dropdown offers four outputs, and the same four appear on a canvas's own Export submenu:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>HTML5 ZIP</b> — the real ad-server deliverable: a self-contained package per size. This is the default and the one that leads the Canvas Settings block.</li>
          <li><b>PNG</b> — a static snapshot of the frame you're on, for networks that can't render the animation.</li>
          <li><b>Video (MP4)</b> — one loop cycle recorded as H.264, for social placements, decks and sign-off emails.</li>
          <li><b>Animated GIF</b> — one loop cycle, looping forever, for chat and email where video won't embed.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Both motion formats show an <b>estimated output size</b> before you start, updating as you change settings or tick sizes. Video estimates are an upper bound (bitrate is a ceiling and simple ads land well under it); GIF estimates are fitted, since GIF size depends on how much of the artwork actually moves.</p>
        <p>"All selected versions" in Data &amp; Versions remains HTML5-ZIP only — pick a single version to export video or GIF.</p>
      `},
      { id: 'export-video', title: 'Video & GIF export', body: `
        <p>Both formats record <b>one loop cycle</b> of the ad and run entirely in your browser: no plugins, no uploads, no software to install.</p>
        <p><b>Frame-accurate, not screen-recorded.</b> The ad isn't filmed off the screen. Each output frame is composed at its exact timestamp on a virtual clock that drives the storyboard's timers and every animation in lockstep, so nothing can drop a frame because the machine was busy — the same export produces a byte-identical file every time. Expect roughly 50 ms per frame, so a 15-second ad renders in well under a minute, with live progress and a working Cancel.</p>
        <p><b>Video settings:</b> FPS (24/30/60) and a bitrate slider — the Low / Medium / High buttons park it at 1, 2.5 and 5 Mbps, and the track runs on to 16 Mbps. Exports are H.264 MP4; on a browser that can't encode H.264 the export quietly produces a WebM instead, and with no video encoding at all it says so and names a browser that works.</p>
        <p><b>GIF settings:</b> FPS (10/20/25 — all divide evenly into GIF's hundredth-of-a-second timing, so playback speed is exact) and palette size (32–256 colours, default 256). One palette is quantised from a sample across <em>every</em> frame, so artwork that only appears part-way through still gets a say in it. GIF holds 256 colours at most, so gradients and photographs band; video keeps them clean.</p>
        <p><b>Known limits:</b> animated GIF assets inside the ad appear as their first frame, and odd-pixel sizes gain a 1px background sliver because H.264 requires even dimensions.</p>
      `},
      { id: 'export-preview-panel', title: 'Render, review, then save', body: `
        <p>Exporting a <em>single</em> canvas to Video or GIF opens a settings panel and renders into it rather than handing you a file. Encoder settings are the kind you judge by looking — whether 20fps is choppy, whether 64 colours banded a gradient — so <b>Render</b> plays the result inside the panel at 1:1, with its frame count and real file size underneath. Change any setting and the preview dims and says so, the button becoming <b>Re-render</b>. <b>Esc</b> cancels a render in progress; a second <b>Esc</b> closes.</p>
        <p>The panel shapes itself around the ad: a portrait banner sits beside the controls, a landscape one underneath, always at 100% unless the window genuinely can't fit it (in which case it scales and labels itself). Video previews get real playback controls so you can stop on a specific beat.</p>
        <p>Getting the file out, in order of usefulness:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Drag the preview</b> straight onto a slide, an email draft, a chat window or a folder — the real animated file lands there, with no download step.</li>
          <li><b>Download</b> — writes it to disk.</li>
          <li><b>Right-click → Save image as…</b> — the browser's own menu works on the preview; same bytes as Download.</li>
          <li><b>Copy</b> (GIF only) — puts a <em>still</em> of the current frame on the clipboard, and says so. Browsers only accept PNG for clipboard images and re-encode what they're given, which flattens animation; dragging is the way to move an animation between apps.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Everything here happens on your machine from a local blob. Nothing is uploaded — only the <b>Share</b> button ever uploads anything.</p>
        <p>The multi-size Export dialog still downloads straight away (one file, or a ZIP when several sizes are ticked) — previewing six sizes in one panel would help nobody.</p>

        <p>Adflow ships two standalone pages alongside the editor, both opened from the <b>File</b> menu and both running entirely in the browser. They exist so people who don't design ads never have to learn the editor to do their part of the job.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Preview Portal</b> — a review surface. Step through every banner size, frame and data version of a project, or examine a third-party HTML5 ad that wasn't built in Adflow at all.</li>
          <li><b>Batch Operation</b> — a production surface for other teams. Open a certified Adflow template, drop in a data sheet, export the whole pack.</li>
        </ul>

Send colleagues the portal link rather than the editor's — they get exactly the controls they need and nothing they don't.</div>
      `},
      { id: 'preview-portal', title: 'Preview Portal', body: `
        <p><b>File → Preview Portal…</b> opens the review page on its own, with nothing loaded. From the empty prompt you can <b>Open Adflow Project…</b> (a <code>.flow</code> file) or <b>Open HTML5 Ad (.zip)…</b>, or drop either kind anywhere on the page. Cloud projects are deliberately not offered here — this is a local-file tool.</p>
        <p>With an Adflow project open, the sidebar gives you:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Playback</b> — <b>Animated</b> or <b>Static only</b>, <b>Restart Timeline</b>, and a <b>Loop timeline</b> override that affects the preview only, never the exported ad's own loop setting.</li>
          <li><b>Frame Select</b> — <i>All frames</i>, or jump to and play any single frame across every size at once.</li>
          <li><b>Data Version</b> — step through the merge rows and see every size update live (shown only when the project has a data sheet).</li>
          <li><b>Banners Sizes</b> — tick which sizes to show, with Select All / Clear All, plus a per-banner KB estimate.</li>
          <li><b>Presentation Grid / BG</b> — a real Adflow theme for the backdrop (<b>Adflow</b> or <b>Light</b>, applied exactly as the editor applies them), and a separate checkered option you can layer over either for reviewing ads with transparent edges.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Each banner card carries its own <b>Restart</b> and <b>Download HTML5</b> buttons; <b>Download All (.zip)</b> in the header packages every visible size at once.</p>
      `},
      { id: 'external-ads', title: 'Reviewing non-Adflow HTML5 ads', body: `
        <p>The Preview Portal can also review a <b>standalone HTML5 ad built outside Adflow</b> — anything supplied as a zip containing an <code>index.html</code> plus its assets. Use <b>Open HTML5 Ad (.zip)…</b>, or drop the zips on the page.</p>
        <p><b>Up to 10 ads at once</b>, laid out side by side exactly the way banner sizes are, so you can compare a whole set in one view. <b>+ Add Ad (.zip)</b> adds more to what's already open (the counter shows how many slots are left).</p>
        <p>Each zip is unpacked and folded into a single self-contained page: stylesheets and scripts are inlined, and every image, font and media reference is rewritten — including ones the ad's own JavaScript loads by name — so it plays with no server and nothing uploaded.</p>
        <p><b>Ad size</b> is read from the standard <code>ad.size</code> meta tag, falling back to a <code>300x250</code>-style hint in the file name. If neither is present the ad is shown at 300×250 and flagged, and you can correct the dimensions per ad in the sidebar (the label tells you where the current size came from).</p>
        <p><b>Controls</b> are limited to what genuinely applies to someone else's ad:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Restart All</b> — remounts every ad from the start.</li>
          <li><b>Loop</b> + <b>Replay every N sec</b> — Adflow can't read a third-party ad's timeline, so Loop simply reloads them all on the interval you set.</li>
          <li><b>Per-ad Restart and Remove</b>, from the sidebar row or the ad's own card footer.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Adflow's timeline, frame and data-version controls are hidden in this mode, since they can't reach inside a third-party ad. Opening an Adflow project swaps back to the full control set — the two modes never mix.</p>
      `},
      { id: 'batch-portal', title: 'Batch Operation portal', body: `
        <p><b>File → Batch Operation…</b> opens a page built for teams who need to produce ad packs from a template without learning the editor. It opens straight into its workspace — no start-up screen — and walks through three numbered steps in the sidebar.</p>
        <p><b>1 · Template.</b> <b>Open Template File…</b> (or drop a <code>.flow</code> anywhere on the page). Only genuine Adflow <b>templates</b> are accepted — files saved from the editor via <b>File ▸ Save ▸ Save template</b>. Ordinary project files are declined with an explanation, so teams always start from a vetted base. Templates opened before are remembered on that machine and offered on the empty prompt for one-click reopening.</p>
        <p><b>2 · Data Sheet.</b> <b>Download Sheet Template</b> gives you a CSV already carrying this template's column headers; fill it in, then <b>Import Data Sheet…</b> to bring it back — one ad version per row. <b>Edit Data &amp; Versions…</b> opens the same Data &amp; Versions panel the editor uses, so rows can be reviewed and corrected in place, with live banner previews per version. Importing a sheet whose headers have been renamed warns immediately rather than silently exporting default content.</p>
        <p><b>3 · Export.</b> One click produces every data version × every ticked banner size, packed into a single ZIP with one folder per version, through the standard export pipeline — the same output the editor produces.</p>
        <p>Alongside the three steps the sidebar keeps playback controls (Animated / Static only, Restart Timeline, Loop timeline), the data-version stepper, and the banner-size checklist. There is deliberately no frame picker (the grid always plays whole ads) and no appearance controls — the portal always renders in the standard Adflow theme so it can't drift from the editor.</p>
        <p>A file the portal can't accept reports the problem in place: on the empty prompt as a short message under the heading, with the button becoming <b>Try another file</b>; if you already have a template open it arrives as a notice and your work stays on screen untouched.</p>

        <p><b>Question:</b> How do I build a full campaign banner set quickly from scratch?</p>
        <p><b>Answer:</b> Follow these streamlined steps:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><b>Create Project</b>: Click <b>File → New Project...</b>, enter your project name, default ClickTag, and select targeted formats (e.g. 300×250, 728×90, 160×600).</li>
          <li><b>Core Design</b>: Click to focus the <b>300×250</b> canvas. Add background elements, copy, headlines, logos, and CTA buttons. Arrange layout coordinates exactly how you want them.</li>
          <li><b>Generate Set</b>: Click the canvas background, hit <b>Auto-resize</b> in the left panel, select your target formats, and click <b>Create Resize</b>. Adflow handles placements and sets up Link Groups automatically.</li>
          <li><b>Refine & Sync</b>: Double-click text layers to edit copy across sizes in real time (via Live-Link).</li>
          <li><b>Batch Export</b>: Hit the <b>Export</b> button in the top bar to package ZIP archives for all canvases.</li>
        </ol>
        <div style="font-size: 11.5px; color: var(--text-muted); opacity: 0.8; border-top: 1px solid var(--border-light); padding-top: 8px; margin-top: 16px;"><b>General Tips:</b> Name your canvas layers consistently (e.g., 'Headline 1', 'CTA button') before auto-resizing. The sizer matches identical layer names to set up Link Groups automatically.</div>

      { id: 'faq-data-merge', title: 'Add data merge', body: `
        <p><b>Question:</b> How do I bind columns and merge spreadsheet data to generate version rows?</p>
        <p><b>Answer:</b> Follow this workflow:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><b>Mark Dynamic Slots</b>: Select the element you want to make variable (e.g., a text box). Open the <b>Dynamic Data</b> section of the Properties panel and check the boxes next to the fields you want to merge (e.g., Text Content, Color).</li>
          <li><b>Load Spreadsheet</b>: Open the spreadsheet panel by clicking the <b>Data</b> button in the top bar.</li>
          <li><b>Import/Build Table</b>: Click <b>Import CSV</b> to load a spreadsheet, or click <b>+ Add Column</b> to build columns manually.</li>
          <li><b>Map Columns to Slots</b>: Bind column headers to your dynamic element slots using the dropdown controls.</li>
          <li><b>Preview Versions</b>: Pick a row from the top-bar <b>Version dropdown</b> to preview data values on your canvases in real time.</li>
          <li><b>Export All</b>: Select <b>All versions (separate folders)</b> in the Export menu dropdown to package finished ads for every row.</li>
        </ol>

      { id: 'faq-progress-saving', title: 'Progress saving', body: `
        <p><b>Question:</b> How does autosave work and how do I prevent losing my progress?</p>
        <p><b>Answer:</b> Adflow runs on a local-first architecture to ensure total data safety:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>IndexedDB Autosave</b>: Every modification (dragging, resizing, typing, recolouring) triggers a debounced save directly to your browser's IndexedDB database.</li>
          <li><b>Auto-Restoration</b>: Reopening the page or reloading the tab reads from IndexedDB, restoring your canvases, scroll positions, zoom level, and 50-state undo stack.</li>
          <li><b>File Saves</b>: Pressing <span class="kbd">Ctrl</span>+<span class="kbd">S</span> saves the project as a portable <code>.flow</code> file — the copy to keep, share by email or file server, and reopen on any machine.</li>
          <li><b>Force Browser Save</b>: Pressing <span class="kbd">Ctrl</span>+<span class="kbd">Shift</span>+<span class="kbd">S</span> immediately saves the active project state to the browser's IndexedDB.</li>
        </ul>
        <div style="font-size: 11.5px; color: var(--text-muted); opacity: 0.8; border-top: 1px solid var(--border-light); padding-top: 8px; margin-top: 16px;"><b>General Tips:</b> Use <b>File → Save → Save to File (.flow)</b> from the file menu to download a local backup file to your computer before clearing browser caches or switching machines.</div>

      { id: 'faq-animations', title: 'Animations troubleshooting', body: `
        <p><b>Question:</b> Why aren't my entrance transitions playing?</p>
        <p><b>Answer:</b> Check your layer placements:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Persistent Layers</b>: Elements placed in the **Always Top** or **Always Bottom** sections of the Layers panel remain visible across all frames and do not trigger entrance animations on frame swaps.</li>
          <li><b>Moving Elements</b>: Drag your layers into the **Main Layers (Frame N)** section of the Layers panel, matching them to the specific frame index where the transition should play.</li>
        </ul>
        <div style="font-size: 11.5px; color: var(--text-muted); opacity: 0.8; border-top: 1px solid var(--border-light); padding-top: 8px; margin-top: 16px;"><b>General Tips:</b> Adjust the animation duration and delay sliders in the right panel to create staggered visual entries (e.g., header enters at 0s, button enters at 0.3s) — or drag the bars on the Timeline, which is usually faster. If a layer has no row on the Timeline it has no animation at all; the timeline's ⚙ <i>Show all elements</i> lists the rest.</div>
      `},
      { id: 'faq-timeline-fx', title: 'Retiming an FX effect', body: `
        <p><b>Question:</b> My element's FX bar is hidden under its IN or OUT bar on the Timeline — how do I move it?</p>
        <p><b>Answer:</b> The FX bar is always drawn on top as white diagonal stripes, and a thin strip along its bottom edge stays grabbable even where IN or OUT covers it:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><b>Just moving it?</b> Drag that strip anywhere along the FX bar's length — the effect slides with it.</li>
          <li><b>Need to resize it?</b> Select the layer, then <b>click</b> the FX bar to isolate it. The IN and OUT bars fade back and stop responding, and the whole FX bar becomes draggable with resize handles at both ends.</li>
          <li><b>Done?</b> Press <span class="kbd">Esc</span> or click anywhere else to leave isolation. IN and OUT become grabbable again immediately.</li>
        </ol>
        <div style="font-size: 11.5px; color: var(--text-muted); opacity: 0.8; border-top: 1px solid var(--border-light); padding-top: 8px; margin-top: 16px;"><b>General Tips:</b> An FX effect set to loop forever has no end to drag — only its start moves. Give it a fixed duration in the Animation panel first if you need to shorten it. The stripes animate only on the selected layer, so a busy timeline stays calm.</div>

      { id: 'faq-handoff', title: 'Handing work to another team', body: `
        <p><b>Question:</b> Another team needs to produce ads from my design with their own data. Do they have to learn Adflow?</p>
        <p><b>Answer:</b> No — give them a template and point them at the Batch Operation portal:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><b>Save a template</b>: in the editor, <b>File ▸ Save ▸ Save template</b>. This is what marks the file as a template; the portal declines ordinary project files, so teams always start from a vetted base.</li>
          <li><b>Send them the file</b> plus the portal link (or tell them <b>File → Batch Operation…</b>).</li>
          <li><b>They open it</b>, click <b>Download Sheet Template</b> to get a CSV with your column headers already in place, fill in one row per ad version, and <b>Import Data Sheet…</b>.</li>
          <li><b>They review</b> in the same Data &amp; Versions panel you use, with live previews per version, then hit <b>Export ZIP</b> — every version × every ticked size, one folder per version.</li>
        </ol>
        <div style="font-size: 11.5px; color: var(--text-muted); opacity: 0.8; border-top: 1px solid var(--border-light); padding-top: 8px; margin-top: 16px;"><b>General Tips:</b> Map your dynamic slots and name the columns clearly <i>before</i> saving the template — those names become the sheet's headers, and a renamed header no longer matches its slot. Everything runs in their browser; nothing is uploaded.</div>
      `},
      { id: 'faq-external-ad', title: 'Reviewing a non-Adflow ad', body: `
        <p><b>Question:</b> An agency sent us HTML5 banners that weren't built in Adflow. Can I review them here?</p>
        <p><b>Answer:</b> Yes, in the Preview Portal, as long as each ad is a zip containing an <code>index.html</code> plus its assets:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Open <b>File → Preview Portal…</b> and choose <b>Open HTML5 Ad (.zip)…</b>, or just drop the zips on the page.</li>
          <li>Up to <b>10 ads</b> can be open at once, laid out side by side like banner sizes so you can compare the set.</li>
          <li>Controls are limited to what applies to someone else's ad: <b>Restart All</b>, a <b>Loop</b> that reloads them on an interval you set, and per-ad <b>Restart</b> and <b>Remove</b>.</li>
        </ol>
        <div style="font-size: 11.5px; color: var(--text-muted); opacity: 0.8; border-top: 1px solid var(--border-light); padding-top: 8px; margin-top: 16px;"><b>General Tips:</b> If an ad appears at the wrong dimensions its zip carried no <code>ad.size</code> meta tag and no size in the file name — type the correct width and height into that ad's row. Nothing is uploaded, and Adflow can't read a third-party ad's internal timeline, so frame and version controls are hidden in this mode.</div>

      { id: 'faq-unlinking', title: 'Unlinking elements', body: `
        <p><b>Question:</b> How do I unlink an element to make layout overrides on one size?</p>
        <p><b>Answer:</b> If you need to make custom overrides on one canvas size without propagating changes to others, detach it from the group:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Right-click the element on the canvas viewport.</li>
          <li>Select <b>Link Group → Unlink from group</b>.</li>
          <li>The element is now independent, while the remaining sizes keep their linked status.</li>
        </ol>
        <div style="font-size: 11.5px; color: var(--text-muted); opacity: 0.8; border-top: 1px solid var(--border-light); padding-top: 8px; margin-top: 16px;"><b>General Tips:</b> If you want to keep the copy linked but separate styling, open the Link Groups panel and uncheck specific properties (like Font Size or Fill Color) for the group.</div>
      `},
      { id: 'faq-weight', title: 'Ad weight limits', body: `
        <p><b>Question:</b> What should I do if my ad canvas exceeds the 150 KB weight limit?</p>
        <p><b>Answer:</b> Uncompressed image assets are the main cause of weight flags. Use the built-in Image Compressor:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Select the heavy image on your canvas.</li>
          <li>In the right-hand panel, find the Image Compressor tool next to the file name.</li>
          <li>Adjust the quality slider (e.g., 70% or 80%) to see a live preview of the estimated KB weight.</li>
          <li>Click Compress to overwrite the original image with the compressed version. The output format is determined by Project Settings and automatically preserves transparency by outputting PNG when necessary, or JPEG/WebP otherwise.</li>
        </ol>
        <div style="font-size: 11.5px; color: var(--text-muted); opacity: 0.8; border-top: 1px solid var(--border-light); padding-top: 8px; margin-top: 16px;"><b>General Tips:</b> Avoid uploading large, complex SVGs as elements. Embed simple vector shapes or compress assets beforehand to ensure network compliance.</div>
      `},
      { id: 'faq-offline', title: 'Offline usage', body: `
        <p><b>Question:</b> Does Adflow need an internet connection or an account?</p>
        <p><b>Answer:</b> No. The local edition has no accounts and makes no network requests beyond loading its own files — true of the desktop build and the hosted page alike:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>No Sign-In</b>: The app opens straight into the workspace. There is nothing to register for and no personal data is collected.</li>
          <li><b>No Feature Loss</b>: All layout design, link syncing, spreadsheet merges, Auto-Resize and every export format (ZIP, PNG, video, GIF) run locally. Every library and font ships with the app. The desktop build carries its own browser engine, so Windows and macOS get an identical feature set.</li>
          <li><b>Force Browser Save</b>: Press <span class="kbd">Ctrl</span>+<span class="kbd">Shift</span>+<span class="kbd">S</span> to force-save the project silently to IndexedDB browser storage.</li>
          <li><b>Moving Between Machines</b>: Your work lives wherever you opened Adflow — this browser profile, or the desktop app's own storage. The two are separate. To move a project, save a <code>.flow</code> file (<span class="kbd">Ctrl</span>+<span class="kbd">S</span>) and open it on the other side.</li>
        </ul>
        <div style="font-size: 11.5px; color: var(--text-muted); opacity: 0.8; border-top: 1px solid var(--border-light); padding-top: 8px; margin-top: 16px;"><b>General Tips:</b> Use <b>File → Save → Save to File (.flow)</b> from the file menu to download local backup files onto your hard drive when working offline.</div>

      { id: 'technical-stack-intro', title: 'Introduction', body: `
        <p>Technical Stack details the code architecture, data structure, and layout mechanics for engineering and IT administrators. It covers the vanilla script loading sequence, global state schemas, CSS clip-path masking, browser-side persistence, and how the same files ship as a desktop application, a static site or a Docker container.</p>
        <p>The guide outlines how Adflow operates as a zero-dependency, compilation-free application with no server-side component: every byte it needs ships in the repository, and nothing a user makes leaves their browser unless they save or export a file.</p>
        <p><b>Adflow's Advantage:</b> Clean, vanilla coding standards and structured documentation ensure easy deployment and code readability, facilitating internal IT audits and development integration.</p>
        <div style="font-size: 11.5px; color: var(--text-muted); opacity: 0.8; border-top: 1px solid var(--border-light); padding-top: 8px; margin-top: 16px;"><b>General Tips:</b> Review the individual specification tabs in this section to understand how data flows through the application. Developers can serve the project folder using a simple Python or Node HTTP server to test code edits locally.</div>
      `},
      { id: 'tech-architecture', title: 'Architecture & Sandbox', body: `
        <p>Adflow is engineered as a zero-dependency, compilation-free Single Page Application (SPA). It uses Vanilla JS, HTML5, and CSS3. There are no bundlers (Webpack, Vite) or compilers.</p>
        <p><b>Script Loading Sequence:</b> The app is 25 JavaScript files loaded via sequential <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags — the tag order <i>is</i> the dependency graph. Since they share one global lexical scope, declarations in earlier files are visible to later ones at execution time. Every local tag is version-pinned with a <code>?v=</code> query string so a browser can never pair stale engine code with new page code. The order is:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><b>render-runtime.js</b>: Render and animation helpers shared by the editor, both portals, and the exporter — including the single animation-preset registry, so no surface can offer a preset another doesn't.</li>
          <li><b>auto-resize-engine.js</b> → <b>auto-arrange-config.js</b>: Placement mathematics, collision resolver, and the per-format coordinate specs it reads.</li>
          <li><b>docs-content.js</b>: Internal documentation and changelog history structures.</li>
          <li><b>data-merge.js</b>: CSV merges and version preview state interpolation.</li>
          <li><b>font-subset.js</b> → <b>export-pipeline.js</b>: HarfBuzz glyph subsetting, then the ZIP bundle generator (JSZip) and PNG rasterizer.</li>
          <li><b>color-picker.js</b>: Color palette and gradient stops controller.</li>
          <li><b>Core app</b> (formerly one <code>script.js</code>, split into 14 files in this order): core-state, autosave, <b>local-library</b> (base project + remembered placements in browser storage), link-system, canvas-render, interactions, canvases-panel, layers-assets, props-panel, <b>sequencer</b>, toolbar-import, project-io, project-dialogs, modals, then app-boot last.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><b>Sandbox Preview Engine:</b> Isolation is achieved using dynamic <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> sandboxing with <code>srcdoc</code> injection, which prevents style or script leaks. The editor renders canvases at high performance using CSS <code>transform: translateZ(0)</code> (forces GPU layers) and <code>clip-path: inset(0)</code> to prevent subpixel hairline leaks during viewport pans and zooms.</p>
        <p><b>Portal pages:</b> <code>preview.html</code> and <code>batch.html</code> are standalone documents that load the same version-pinned <code>scripts/</code> engine files plus their own inline page code, and link the app's own <code>styles.css</code> rather than carrying a private palette. A third-party ad zip opened in the Preview Portal is flattened into one self-contained document — stylesheets and scripts inlined, every other asset rewritten to a data URL — and mounted through the same <code>srcdoc</code> sandbox as an Adflow banner.</p>
      `},
      { id: 'tech-state-schema', title: 'Global State Schema', body: `
        <p>A single mutable object named <code>state</code> governs the application's runtime. A TypeScript-style summary of the schema includes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>projectId</b>: String id assigned when a project is created or first saved.</li>
          <li><b>projectName</b>: File display name (defaults to "RMIT_ad").</li>
          <li><b>canvases</b>: Array of canvas elements holding dimensions, fallback backgrounds, and child layer configurations.</li>
          <li><b>activeCanvasId / activeFrameId</b>: Active focal viewport indicators.</li>
          <li><b>linkGroups</b>: Mapping object storing cross-canvas synchronization groups.</li>
          <li><b>dataMerge</b>: Configuration metadata and table row arrays for spreadsheets.</li>
          <li><b>assets</b>: Asset ID mappings to raw base64 data URLs.</li>
          <li><b>frames</b>: Sequential sequence array with duration, skip behaviors, and transition entries.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Each <b>Element</b> layer contains geometric bounding properties (x, y, w, h, rotation), layer placement sections (persistent top, bottom, or frame-specific), auto-detected or manually locked classification roles for the resize engine, and masking/animation configurations.</p>
      `},
      { id: 'tech-resize-engine', title: 'Auto-Resize Engine', body: `
        <p>The Auto-Resize engine is a deterministic, rule-based layout generator. It classifies elements into a 9+1 taxonomy using a 5-step heuristic pipeline:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><b>Layer Name Substring</b>: Matches keys like <i>logo</i> or <i>background</i>.</li>
          <li><b>Regex Text Scan</b>: Identifies CRICOS and RFWN ("Ready for Next") content.</li>
          <li><b>Font Sizes Ranking</b>: Classifies headings and subheadings by finding the largest text styles.</li>
          <li><b>Aspect & Area Analysis</b>: Matches logos and background fills by checking area occupancy.</li>
          <li><b>Element Type Fallbacks</b>: Binds buttons to CTA button roles and loose images to main-image slots.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><b>Placement Pipeline:</b> Resizing clears target canvases, calculates placements through role placer functions, applies R1 edge alignments (linking RFWN and logo bounds), remaps mask target references, resolves overlaps using a priority-sorted collision resolver (shrinking lower-priority layers by the overlap + 4px spacing), and clips bounds to the canvas perimeter.</p>
      `},
      { id: 'tech-masking-sync', title: 'Masking & Link Sync', body: `
        <p><b>Vector Masking:</b> Adflow uses CSS <code>clip-path</code> (revamped from brittle SVG mask nodes to resolve cross-browser rendering bugs). A shape layer directly above an image is marked with <code>isMask: true</code> and tied to the image's <code>maskTargetId</code>. Rotations and dimensions are calculated relative to the target image and baked directly into the SVG polygon or path definition strings during rendering/export.</p>
        <p><b>Link Groups Synchronisation:</b> Changes are propagated through the <code>applyLinkSync</code> method, covering text content, font family, sizes, colors, fills, borders, radius, and continuous animations. When <code>liveLink</code> is enabled, property modifications in the editor trigger a loop that overwrites sibling attributes across all canvases in real time.</p>
      `},
      { id: 'tech-persistence-security', title: 'Persistence & Local Storage', body: `
        <p><b>Local Storage & History:</b> Persistence uses a debounced autosave queue targeting the <code>adflow-autosave</code> IndexedDB database, storing state snapshots and the 50-state history stack. Portable project saves use the <code>.flow</code> file format (a zipped bundle using JSZip 3.10 containing raw state JSON, metadata files, and base64-decoded binary assets).</p>
        <p><b>Base project &amp; remembered placements:</b> the two cross-project preferences live in the same browser profile as autosave. The base project (Settings ▸ Startup) is a <code>.flow</code> blob in the <code>adflow-autosave</code> IndexedDB store under a fixed key, with a small localStorage hint so the New Project dialog can paint its row synchronously. Remembered placements are a compact JSON map keyed <code>&lt;width&gt;x&lt;height&gt;</code> → role in localStorage, read synchronously by the Auto-Resize engine. Both are implemented in <code>scripts/local-library.js</code>.</p>
        <p><b>No server-side state:</b> the local edition has no accounts, no database and no upload path. Nothing a user makes leaves the browser except as a file they chose to save or export. Clearing site data for the Adflow origin removes autosaves, recents, the base project and remembered placements together — keep <code>.flow</code> backups of anything that matters.</p>
      `},
      { id: 'tech-deployment', title: 'Deployment (desktop, Docker & static hosting)', body: `
        <p>Adflow is a static site: HTML, CSS, vanilla JavaScript and a handful of vendored binaries. There is no server-side code, so any static host can serve it — and the same files also ship as a desktop application. All three targets run byte-identical app code; only the wrapper around it differs.</p>
        <p><b>Desktop app (Electron):</b> <code>electron/</code> is roughly 300 lines across three files — a window and menu policy (<code>main.js</code>), a read-only loopback HTTP server (<code>static-server.js</code>) and a preload that exposes a single <code>window.adflowDesktop</code> marker. Nothing in <code>scripts/</code>, <code>styles.css</code> or the three HTML pages was changed to make the desktop build work, so the two editions cannot drift apart. The app serves itself over <code>http://127.0.0.1</code> on a <b>fixed port</b> rather than loading <code>file://</code>: the preview iframes and the export worker need a real origin, browser storage is keyed to that origin (a random port each launch would look like lost work), and Chromium treats loopback as a secure context, which is what keeps WebCodecs video export and the native save dialog working. Electron is used in preference to a system-webview wrapper precisely because it bundles its own Chromium — otherwise the Mac build would quietly lose video export and the native save dialog to Safari's engine. See <code>ELECTRON.md</code>.</p>
        <p><b>Docker (the RMIT ITS deployment):</b> a two-stage <code>Dockerfile</code> runs the two Node generator scripts, then serves the result from <code>nginxinc/nginx-unprivileged</code> — non-root, listening on port <b>8080</b>, with a <code>/healthz</code> endpoint and a container health check. <code>docker compose up -d --build</code> starts it in one command, or double-click <code>run-docker.bat</code> (Windows) / <code>run-docker.command</code> (macOS, Linux). The container holds no state, so it can be recreated freely, and both base images publish <code>arm64</code> so it builds natively on Apple Silicon. The server block in <code>docker/nginx.conf</code> pins MIME types for <code>.wasm</code> and <code>.mjs</code> and sets the cache policy: pages and <code>data/version.txt</code> are never cached, version-pinned code for an hour, binaries and fonts for 30 days.</p>
        <p><b>Only the host machine needs Docker.</b> Everyone else opens the URL in a browser with nothing installed, which is what makes a mixed Windows and Mac team a non-issue. Chrome and Edge get the full feature set; Safari and Firefox fall back to a download instead of a native save dialog, and video export needs Chrome or Edge (GIF export works everywhere).</p>
        <p><b>Vercel or any static host:</b> <code>vercel.json</code> declares the same build command and output root with matching headers. The requirements for any other host are the same three: serve <code>.wasm</code> as <code>application/wasm</code>, serve <code>.mjs</code> as JavaScript, and do not cache <code>index.html</code> or <code>data/version.txt</code>. Serving over <code>file://</code> is not supported because the sandboxed preview iframes need an HTTP origin.</p>
        <p><b>No outbound requests:</b> every library (JSZip, iro.js, mediabunny, gifenc, HarfBuzz) and every font (the brand fonts and the portals' Inter and Outfit) is in the repository, so the deployed app works on a network with no internet egress.

      "Two Themes Instead of Thirteen: Settings now offers Adflow, the dark palette the app has always opened in, and Light. The other eleven — Obsidian, Nordic, Amber, Amethyst, RMIT Navy, Ocean, Navy, RMIT, Nordic Light, Amber Light and Sage Light — have been removed. Each of them was a second full set of colours that had to be checked against every new panel, dialog and table, and in practice nobody was reaching past the two that shipped first. The picker is a single row now rather than two labelled groups, because with two named themes the labels said less than the names already did.",
      "Old Projects Still Open Properly: a project saved while one of the removed themes was active would have had no palette left to apply. Any theme the app no longer recognises now folds back to the default, so an old file opens looking the way a new one does instead of on a half-styled interface.",
      "The Preview Portal Follows: its backdrop swatches are the same two themes, applied exactly the way the editor applies them. The checkered backdrop is unchanged — still a separate toggle you can layer over either theme for reviewing ads with transparent edges.",
      "The About Box Tells the Truth: it had been reporting v0.44.0 since that release, whatever version you were actually running, because the number was typed into the dialog by hand. It now reads the running version, so it cannot drift again.",
      "Documentation Rewritten to Match the App: this manual, the README and the architecture reference had all drifted. They described thirteen themes, a sign-in screen, cloud projects, share links and a script file that no longer exists — all removed in earlier releases. Every one of those passages has been rewritten or deleted. The manual also gains a plain explanation of the two ways Adflow is run — as a desktop app or as a page your team hosts — and of the one thing that genuinely catches people out: the two keep separate storage, so a project started in one does not appear in the other unless you save a .flow file and open it on the other side.",
      "Removed a Leftover From the Old Sign-In Screen: a screenshot of the sign-in gate was still sitting in the documentation images, months after the gate itself was removed. It was also quietly breaking the tool that regenerates those screenshots, which waited for a screen that never appears."

      "Scrollbars Are Thin and Themed Instead of Browser Default: every scrollable panel used the browser's own scrollbar — around 15 pixels wide with stepper arrows at each end. Inside a dark design tool that read as leftover web-page furniture, and in the desktop app, where there is no browser around it, it simply looked wrong. Every scrollbar across the editor and both portals is now a thin rounded bar that takes its colour from the active theme, brightens when you point at it and turns accent-coloured while you drag it. The arrows are gone and the track is transparent, but the bar still sits inside a 10 pixel pointer target, so it is no harder to grab than it was. The three places that had their own hand-rolled thin scrollbar — the documentation panel, dropdown lists and the export dialog — now share the one style rather than each looking slightly different."

      'Adflow Now Runs Entirely in Your Browser, With No Account: the sign-in gate, the account chip, Cloud Projects, Team Spaces, invitations, Revert to Cloud Version and Share Preview are gone, along with the Supabase backend behind them. Nothing you make leaves your machine unless you save or export a file. Autosave, Open Recent, Save to Browser, .flow files, templates, both portals and every export format work exactly as before. This is the edition RMIT deploys internally; the cloud-connected build stays on its own branch.',
      'Ctrl+S Saves a .flow File: it used to push to the cloud and only warn when you were signed out. It now does what File ▸ Save ▸ Save to File does — the native save dialog where the browser has one, a download otherwise — and the Save menu and the shortcut reference both say so. Ctrl+Shift+S still saves silently to the browser.',
      'Base Project and Remembered Placements Now Live in This Browser: both used to be stored on your account. The base project is kept in the browser database alongside autosave, remembered placements in local storage. Settings shows the same two blocks as before, always, and every message says "in this browser" rather than "on your account". They do not follow you to another machine — save a .flow of your base project if you need it elsewhere.',
      'Nothing Is Fetched From the Internet Any More: JSZip and the iro colour picker ship inside the app instead of loading from a CDN, the export worker uses that same copy, and the two portals carry their own Inter and Outfit fonts instead of asking Google Fonts. The app renders identically on a network with no internet access.',
      'Preview Portal Opens Files Only: with share links gone, the portal no longer accepts a snapshot URL, and the Update Preview button and the "Shared on …" line under the project name are removed. Drag-and-drop and Open still work for .flow projects and for third-party HTML5 ad zips.',
      'Old Files Still Open Cleanly: .flow files saved by the cloud edition may carry share pointers and cloud stamps. They are dropped on open, so nothing stale is carried into a new save, a template or the base project.',
      'The RMIT Logo Now Loads on Linux Hosting: the default white logo was referenced as RMIT_White.svg while the file is RMIT_white.svg. Windows never noticed the difference; a Linux web server (the Docker image, Vercel) does, and the logo came up missing. Every reference now uses the real filename, projects and autosaves saved by older builds are corrected as they open, and both servers alias the old spelling as well.',
      'Docker-Ready, Without a Terminal: the repository now includes a Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml and nginx configuration that serve the app from a non-root nginx container on port 8080 with a health check, plus a vercel.json for static hosting and a DEPLOYMENT.md for operators. Double-click launchers are provided for both platforms — run-docker.bat and stop-docker.bat on Windows, run-docker.command and stop-docker.command on macOS and Linux — each starting Docker if it is not running, building, launching and opening the browser. Only the machine hosting the app needs Docker; everyone else opens a URL with nothing installed.'

      'Placements You Set Can Now Follow Your Account Instead of One Project: pinning where a role belongs used to write to the canvas you were on, inside the .flow you had open. Get a 300 × 250 laid out exactly right and the next project started from the built-in rules again. Placements can now be remembered against your account, keyed by the canvas dimensions and the role, so Auto-Resize starts from your layout in every project, on every machine you sign in to. The size is the only thing that identifies it — a 1080 × 1080 keeps its placement whether it came from the preset list as Instagram Square, was typed in by hand, or was renamed afterwards. Project-only is still there and still the default choice; the two are separate destinations rather than a preference, and the menu says which is which.',
      'Auto-arrange Is in the Canvas Menu, and Now Holds Both Halves of the Idea: Auto-arrange was reachable only from the element menu, so re-laying out a canvas meant selecting something on it first. It is now in the canvas right-click menu too, and in both menus it has become a submenu holding two things: the arrange itself, and Save placement. They belong together — one lays a canvas out from the rules, the other teaches the rules what you laid out — rather than sitting as two neighbours competing for the same spot in a long menu. From the canvas menu, Save placement records every role-assigned layer on that canvas at once; from a layer or a multi-selection it records just those, and the label counts them so you can see the scope before you commit.',
      'Auto-arrange Says Whether It Can Actually Do Anything: the command looked identical whether it was about to lay out five layers or silently do nothing, and the built-in rules only exist for the six standard ad sizes. It now reports the truth before you run it. From a canvas, it reads "Auto-arrange elements (3/5)" — three of the five role-assigned layers have a placement, the other two stay where they are. From a layer or a selection, the same count over just those layers. When nothing in scope has a placement at all it greys out and reads "Auto-arrange not defined", with a tooltip naming the canvas size and pointing at Save placement as the way to give it one. Save placement stays available while it is greyed, since that is exactly what you would want next.',
      'Auto-arrange Now Uses Placements You Saved Globally: it honoured a placement saved to the project but ignored one saved to your account, even though both are offered from the same submenu — so choosing "All projects" appeared to do nothing when you then arranged. Both scopes now drive it, project first, at any canvas size. That is also what makes the new count honest: a size the engine has no rule for reads as defined once you have saved a placement for it, and arranging applies exactly that.',
      'Clear Placement Sits Under Save, Mirroring It: the pair reads as one idea with an undo — Save placement and Clear placement, each offering the same two destinations, each scoped the same way (every role-assigned layer on the canvas from the canvas menu, just the selection from a layer). Clearing the project copy leaves an account-wide one alone and vice versa, so neither is ever removed as a side-effect of the other. Each entry only appears when that scope actually holds something for those layers, and the whole row is omitted when neither does: a Clear that can only tell you there was nothing to clear is not worth a click. The Advanced submenu that used to house this is gone, along with "Define default placement" — the Save submenu replaces it and names where it saves.',
      'Layers Are Locked After Auto-arrange, and You Can Turn That Off: a layout you just generated was one stray drag away from being nudged out of place. Every layer Auto-arrange positions is now locked — the logo, RFWN and CRICOS included, with no exceptions — and the settings carry one toggle for it, on by default. Unticking it releases whatever it locked earlier there and then, rather than waiting until the next time you arrange something: a switch that only takes effect on the next run is indistinguishable from one that does not work. Re-ticking re-locks just as immediately, and the toast says how many layers changed.',
      'The Two Lock Settings Now Own Separate Jobs: "Lock brand elements" used to apply to auto-arrange as well, which meant switching the auto-arrange lock OFF still left the logo, RFWN and CRICOS locked — the toggle said it governed layers after auto-arrange, and then did not govern four of them. Each setting now covers exactly what its label claims: the auto-arrange toggle governs auto-arrange entirely, and the brand setting governs the brand layers Auto-Resize copies onto the canvases it generates. Nothing quietly overrides a control you can see is switched off.',
      'The Settings Panel Is Now Auto Resize / Arrange Settings: it has governed both for a long time — the brand-lock rule it holds has always applied to auto-arrange as much as auto-resize — and the new lock toggle made the old title actively misleading.',
      'Live Linking Is One Decision Instead of Six: the five per-category switches under it (text, font family and weight, colour and fill, opacity, animations) are gone. They made the section four times as tall as the choice it was actually offering, and all five were on for anyone who had live linking on at all. Live linking now covers all of them whenever it is enabled, stated in a line under the toggle. Position, size and font size stay independent per canvas, as before. A project saved with one of those categories switched off has it cleared on open rather than carrying a setting you could no longer see or change.',
      'Remembered Placements Are Visible and Reversible: Settings now lists how many placements are held across how many canvas sizes, with one button that forgets all of them. Invisible state that changes how Auto-Resize behaves in projects you have not opened yet needed somewhere to be seen and a way back to the built-in rules.',
      'Signed-Out Adflow No Longer Shows Settings It Cannot Use: every control that needs an account was either sitting there greyed out with an explanation, or opening a dialog whose only content was a prompt to sign in. In local mode they are now simply absent — the cloud open and save entries, Share Preview and its toolbar button, the base project block, and the new remembered-placements block. They come back the moment you sign in, with no reload. An action you cannot take is not a menu item.'

      'A Blank Board Is No Longer Limited to the Six Standard Sizes: the Canvases list in New Project was a fixed set of six tick boxes, so any project needing anything else started by adding canvases one at a time afterwards. The list is now yours to build. Type a width and height and press Add, or pick from a catalogue of forty-three standard sizes — display ad units, social formats, screen and device sizes, and common raster design sizes including A4, A5 and US Letter — which fills the two boxes for you so you can nudge the numbers before committing. Anything you add joins the list as a row of its own, tick box and all, and can be removed again with the × beside it. The six RMIT display sizes are still there, still ticked, so a project you would have made before is made exactly the same way.',
      'Added Canvases Stack With the Rest, Not Beside Them: a size you add lays out through the same packing as the presets, so a new project opens as one tidy block whatever it is made of, and no two canvases ever land on top of each other. The packing itself got smarter about it: it used to wrap rows at a fixed width, which was right for six small ad units but turned a longer list — or one 1920-wide canvas — into a tall thin strip that ran off the bottom of the board. It now aims for a roughly square block and widens further if that is what it takes to fit, and centring the block on the board is clamped so no canvas can end up at a coordinate you cannot reach. If a set genuinely needs more room than the 3000 × 3000 board has, the dialog says so while you can still change it, with the exact size it would need.',
      'A Size You Type In Gets Its Proper Name: enter 300 × 250 by hand and the row says Medium Rectangle, not "Custom" — it is the same canvas either way, and that name is what labels it in the Canvases list, the batch panel and the export report afterwards. Adding a size that is already in the list but switched off simply switches it back on rather than leaving you with a duplicate row.',
      'Project Name and ClickTag Now Share the Top Row: they are the two fields you always type rather than pick, so they lead the dialog together, with the name given two thirds of the width to keep it the more prominent of the pair. Max ad size is no longer as wide as the field beside it either — it holds a three-digit number, and being sized for a sentence only made it look like it wanted one.',
      'Resizing a Canvas Now Waits Until You Say So: the width and height boxes in Canvas Settings resized the canvas on every keystroke, so typing 500 dragged it through 5 and 50 first, reflowing every auto-sized layer each time and leaving an undo step behind for each. They now hold a pending size until you apply it. An Apply and Cancel pair appears only while there is something pending, along with the new size in plain text; Enter applies, Esc discards, and the whole change is a single undo step. Nothing is in the way when you are not resizing.',
      'A Canvas Can Be Turned On Its Side: a swap button between the two boxes exchanges width and height, so going from portrait to landscape is one click instead of retyping both numbers and remembering which was which. Like everything else there it sets the pending size and waits for Apply.',
      'Canvas Settings Can Retarget to Any Standard Size: a preset picker under the dimensions offers the same forty-three sizes as New Project, so an existing canvas can be switched to Instagram Square, Desktop HD or A4 without starting a new project. It also reads back the current size by name, which means the panel now tells you what a canvas IS and not only how many pixels it is.',
      'Add Canvas Offers the Whole Catalogue, in Submenus: the + button in the Canvases panel listed the same six display sizes and nothing else. It now opens the four catalogue groups as submenus — a flat list of forty-three would be a list nobody reads — with a custom width and height row at the bottom, so it stays a way to make any canvas rather than a picker of the ones we thought of.',
      'A Newly Added Canvas Lands in Free Space: it used to be dropped at a fixed diagonal offset that took no account of where your canvases actually were, so once you had moved the group, the next canvas you added appeared on top of it. It now looks for room next to the ones already there — continuing the block where it can, and searching for the nearest clear space when it cannot. If the board has no free space that size at all, it goes below the others and says so rather than covering something up.'

A section header sitting flush against the bottom edge looked like the end of the panel rather than the middle of it, and the only way to find out otherwise was to try scrolling. A soft fade now appears at whichever edge has content beyond it — at the bottom when there is more below, at the top once you have scrolled away from it, at both when you are somewhere in the middle, and at neither when everything already fits.

The stripes now run only in focus mode — the isolated bar you get by clicking one that is already selected. Motion means something again: whatever is moving is what you are editing.',
      'The FX Bar Says What Clicking It Does: a resting FX bar is a static striped outline, and the click that opens focus mode could only be found by trying it. Hovering one now lifts it and names the action in the middle of the bar — "Click to select" on a row that is not selected yet, "Click to edit" on the row that is. Bars too short to hold the words without cutting them mid-way leave the label off rather than showing half of it, and a bar already in focus mode stops offering what you are doing.',
      'IN and OUT Bars Can Be Resized Where the FX Bar Covers Them: an FX bar frequently spans the whole row and sits above the IN and OUT bars, so their end grips were unreachable — you could drag those bars sideways underneath it, but never resize them. Starting a drag from the last few pixels of a buried IN or OUT bar now resizes it from that end, exactly as grabbing the exposed grip does; the cursor changes to the resize arrows and the hover label switches to "Drag to resize" so the zone is visible before you commit. Dragging from anywhere else still moves the bar, and a plain click anywhere still opens the FX bar for editing.'

Right for most reviews." — so the list is never silent about what you just picked. Never is the only option that raises a warning, in amber, and it is kept short: the link never stops working on its own, so anyone it reaches keeps access, including to every later cloud save, until you delete it here.

A share link points at a snapshot file, and the only record of which snapshot belongs to a project was being written to this browser rather than to the project’s cloud copy. Open the same project on another machine, or after clearing your browser data, and Adflow was working from the previous snapshot’s address: making a new link revoked one that was already dead and left the real, live link belonging to nothing. It kept working, for as long as its expiry allowed, invisible to the Share dialog, to deleting the project and to the storage audit. The pointer is now saved to the cloud as part of making the link, and the old snapshot is not removed until that has succeeded.',

A guard added earlier today — meant to stop the fitter measuring a box with no layout at all — was checking that BEFORE the unhiding, so every layer on a later frame was treated as unmeasurable and kept the size sitting in its disabled Font size box instead.

One per account, replaced whenever you press the button again, cleared with one click, and stored on your cloud account rather than this machine — so it follows you to every browser you sign in to. Saving it is the only step; there is no separate switch to remember.',
      'New Project Asks Where to Start: the top of the dialog is one list of three equal choices — Base project, Use template, Blank board — replacing the "Use template" tick box that used to sit above the canvas settings. They are all the same kind of decision, so none is styled to outrank the others, each carries a single line saying what it does, and the template picker sits on the template row itself. Base project leads and is preselected when you have one; it disappears entirely when you do not, so the list is never padded with an option that cannot do anything. Blank board is always one click away — saved never means forced.',
      'The Four Fields That Would Have Fought It: a base project already contains canvases, a ClickTag, a max ad size and a background, and so does the New Project dialog. Rather than letting the panel show values that quietly lose, the two are split: the base project supplies the canvases and their content, so the Canvases list greys out with a line saying why, and ClickTag, max ad size and background stay editable and are applied on top. Nothing in the dialog is left enabled but ignored.',
      'What a Base Project Deliberately Does Not Carry: it is stripped the same way "Save template" strips a template — no undo history, no selection, no zoom or scroll position, no guides, no asset library, no active data version — and then stripped again for identity, so it cannot hand a share link, a "saved to cloud" stamp, a team-space binding or its old project name to every project made from it. Only the design comes through.',
      'It Stays Out of Cloud Projects: the base project is stored under your account but is not a cloud project, so it never appears in that list and cannot be opened, renamed or deleted by accident. The Settings row that created it is the only place that manages it.',
      'Deleting a Cloud Project Now Removes Its Share Snapshot Too: a share link does not point at your project file — it points at a separate snapshot written alongside it, and the only record of where that snapshot lives is a field inside the project file itself. So deleting a project removed the project and left its snapshot behind forever: nothing referenced it, no screen listed it, and storage objects do not expire the way signed URLs do. Deleting a project now reads that field first and removes both, and deleting a whole team space does the same for every project in it. Snapshots belonging to other members of a shared space are left alone, since they sit under storage owned by them and were never ours to remove.'

It is now a pointer with a motion arc, because the control is entirely about what happens when you point at something. Nothing about how it works has changed.',

They behave exactly as the top-bar pair does — moving between real versions and wrapping around the ends, without stopping at "No version" on the way past.',
      'Hover Preview Can Be Switched On and Off From Inside a Preview: the hover-preview toggle now also appears on that same bar, beside the arrows.

It is one gesture — pointing at something to see it — so it now sits behind one switch. Armed, you can still flick down the version list and watch the board change; switched off, the list behaves like an ordinary dropdown and the version only changes when you click a row. This covers the dropdown everywhere it appears: the toolbar switcher while you are editing, and the floating bar in single-canvas and full preview. Turning the toggle off part-way through a hover puts the version you were on back.',

      'Auto-Sized Text No Longer Changes Size When You Preview: an auto-sized headline could come back from Preview at a different size to the one on the canvas — usually larger, re-wrapped onto an extra line, and wide enough to run off the edge of the banner. The canvas and the preview were each working out the size for themselves, and the preview did its sum inside the iframe at the moment the ad started. If that iframe had no layout yet, every measurement read as zero, every candidate size therefore "fitted", and the search happily returned your Max size — the largest font the element was allowed. The preview now uses the size the canvas already computed, baked into the ad when it is built, so the two cannot disagree; the text settles at exactly what you approved. The old in-ad fitter is still there for ads exported before this change, and it now refuses to measure a box with no layout rather than guessing upward. Buttons with Auto-size get the same treatment.',

All three now share one copy, which means a ZIP downloaded from the batch portal has the same text size as the same canvas exported from the editor.

      'Single-Canvas Exports Now Render Into the Panel Instead of Straight to Disk: exporting one canvas to Video or GIF used to hand you a file and leave you to open it. Encoder settings are the kind you judge by looking — whether 20fps is choppy, whether 64 colours banded the gradient — so Render now draws the result inside the Export panel, playing on a loop at the size it will ship at, with its frame count and real file size underneath. Download writes it only when you ask. Change any setting and the preview dims and says so, with the button becoming Re-render, so what is on screen is never quietly out of date. Esc cancels a render in progress; a second Esc closes. The multi-size Export dialog still downloads straight away — previewing six sizes in one small panel would help nobody.',
      'The Preview Sizes Itself to the Ad, Always at 100%: a portrait banner sits beside the controls and a landscape one underneath, because the opposite arrangement leaves a wide band of empty checkerboard around it. The preview box is cut to the media\'s exact pixel size, so there is no padding to read as a gap, and the panel grows to suit — 1:1, never scaled down, unless the window genuinely cannot fit it, in which case it scales and labels itself ("shown at 70%") rather than quietly misrepresenting the size. The panel always OPENS in the same shape whichever canvas you came from; the aspect ratio only gets a say once there is actually something to show.',
      'Tall Previews Put Everything Side by Side: with a 600px-tall banner, the settings, the note and the buttons all move into a column beside the preview rather than stacking under it, so the panel is only as tall as the ad itself instead of running off the bottom of the screen. Landscape ads keep the natural top-to-bottom order with the buttons at the foot.',

"Save image as…" is the one worth knowing about: it writes the genuine animated GIF, the same bytes Download gives you. Right-clicking anywhere else in the app is unchanged.',

This is the only route that hands another application a working animation, which is worth explaining: page scripts may only put PNG on the clipboard, and even the browser\'s own Copy Image flattens a GIF to a bitmap because the Windows clipboard has no GIF format at all. Sites that seem to copy an animated GIF are really copying an <img src="https://…"> tag and letting the receiving app fetch that public address — which needs a public address, exactly what a local render doesn\'t have. Dragging sidesteps all of it by passing a file rather than a picture.',
      'Copy a GIF to the Clipboard: a Copy button beside Download, for when a flat image is all you need.

      'Export Moved to the Top of the Canvas Menu: right-clicking a canvas puts Export directly under Preview and Auto-Resize, in the same accent style and with its own icon, instead of buried among the housekeeping items near the bottom. It is what the canvas is for. Its submenu now names the formats the way the Export dialog does — HTML5 ZIP, PNG, Video…, GIF….',
      'Right-Click Menus Now Say What They Act On: a small grey heading tops every context menu — "Text options", "Canvas options · 160×600", "3 elements selected", "Board options". The menus share a lot of wording and a right-click a few pixels off lands on the board instead of the layer, so naming the target beats discovering it from the result. Single selections name their type (and flag a mask as one); multiple selections show the count, which doubles as confirmation that a group grabbed everything you expected.',
      'Fixed Photos Coming Out Colour-Shifted in GIFs: a GIF carries one palette for the whole animation, and that palette was picked by looking at a single frame in the middle of the ad. On a brand-heavy banner — flat colour field, solid text slab, and a photo that arrives partway through — the sampled frame often held nothing but the flat colours, so the palette was built almost entirely from those, and the photograph was then forced onto the nearest thing available: the background or the text slab. The result was a photo visibly cast toward one of them rather than merely a little posterised. The palette is now quantised from a sample taken across every frame of the animation, so anything the ad shows at any point gets a say in it. On a reconstruction of the failing case the photo\'s average channel error dropped from 13/143/112 to 3/2/3.',
      'GIFs Now Default to the Full 256 Colours: the palette default was 128.

Drop it back down when you want a smaller file and the artwork is flat.',
      'Every Format in the Canvas Panel: the Canvas Settings panel\'s two download buttons are now an "Export this canvas" section carrying all four formats. HTML5 ZIP leads it — full width, accent-outlined, and named for what it actually is rather than just "Download ZIP" — because it is the real ad-server deliverable; PNG, Video and GIF sit beneath it as an even row of three. Video and GIF open their settings popup rather than firing blind, since each needs a frame rate and a quality choice. Preview and Auto-resize stay above as canvas actions, where they belong.',
      'Animated GIF Export: GIF joins the format list, in the Export dialog and on the right-click menu. It rides the same frame-accurate recorder the video export uses — same virtual clock, same deterministic output — so a GIF and an MP4 of the same ad show exactly the same frames. Loops forever, as a banner should. Settings are FPS (10/20/25, all of which divide evenly into GIF\'s hundredth-of-a-second timing so playback speed is exact) and palette size (32–256 colours). GIF holds 256 colours at most, so gradients and photos band; the panel says as much and points at video when that matters. No video encoder is involved, so GIF works even on browsers that cannot encode H.264.',

      'Estimated Output Size: both motion formats now show what the export will roughly weigh before you start it, updating as you change bitrate, palette, frame rate, or which sizes are ticked. For video it is an upper bound (bitrate is a ceiling, and simple ads land well under it); for GIF it is a fitted estimate, since GIF size depends on how much of the artwork actually moves.',
      'Video Export: the Export dialog has a third format — Video — that records one full loop of each selected size and hands you ready-to-play files. Everything happens in the browser: no plugins, no uploads, no software to install. One size downloads as a single video; several sizes arrive zipped together. Two knobs: FPS (24/30/60) and a bitrate slider — the Low / Medium / High buttons park it at 1, 2.5 and 5 Mbps, and the track runs on to 16 Mbps for anyone who wants more fidelity at a bigger file.',
      'Quick Video Export: right-click a canvas → Export → Video… records just that one size. A small popup takes the same FPS and bitrate settings (it shows the size and loop length it\'s about to record), then downloads the video directly — no trip through the Export dialog.',
      'Frame-Accurate, Not Screen-Recorded: the ad is not filmed off the screen — every output frame is composed at its exact timestamp on a virtual clock that drives the ad\'s storyboard timers and animations in lockstep. Nothing can drop a frame or stutter because the machine was busy: the same export produces the identical file every single time, byte for byte. A 15-second ad renders in well under a minute, with live progress and a working Cancel.',
      'MP4 First, WebM Where It Must: exports are H.264 MP4 — the format that plays in PowerPoint, on phones, in email clients and everywhere else. On a browser that cannot encode H.264, the export quietly produces a WebM instead of failing; with no video encoding support at all, it says so plainly and names a browser that works. Known limits: animated GIF assets appear as their first frame, and odd-pixel ad sizes gain a 1px background sliver (H.264 requires even dimensions).',
      'New FX Preset — Underline: the first effect that paints ON a layer rather than moving it. Every preset before it nudged, scaled, spun or faded the layer; this one leaves it exactly where it was put and wipes a rule in beneath the words, holds it, then wipes it out the far side.',
      'It Underlines the Text, Not the Layer: the rule is drawn on the type itself, so it is only as wide as the words and sits directly under them — not stretched across a layer box that is usually wider and taller than the text inside it. Wrapped copy gets one underline per line, each the width of its own line, and they re-measure themselves when a data-merge swap or an auto-resize re-wraps the text.',

Offered on text and buttons only — elsewhere there is no type for it to hug. The colour field opens the usual palette without the gradient tab, since a gradient would land nested inside the rule\'s own fill. On a text layer that already has BG turned on, the background covers the rule; the panel says so rather than leaving you guessing.',

Off, the bar is simply not drawn and the text slides out of nothing — Reveal\'s masked motion turned sideways with no visible edge, which suits a layer where the caret would read as clutter. The timing is deliberately left alone: the text still waits out the beat the cursor would have held and still lands on the configured duration, so ticking the bar off never re-times an ad built around the preset\'s rhythm. The Cursor Color control hides with it, since there is nothing left to colour, and Line by line drops every line\'s cursor together.',
      'Animate BG on Pop and Reveal: both entrances now have the "Animate BG" toggle that Typing has, so a text layer\'s background arrives with its text instead of sitting on screen waiting for it. One bar per visual line fills in left to right, timed to the units landing on that line — words rising or popping into a bar that draws itself under them, rather than onto one that was already there. Reveal by Lines and Pop by Lines give each bar its line\'s whole slot in the stagger, so bar and line move as one beat; the letter and word modes spread each bar across the units that landed on it. Wrapped lines count as lines, measured off the laid-out text, so the bars re-derive themselves when a data-merge swap or an auto-resize re-wraps the copy.',
      'BG Offset on Pop and Reveal: the same lead/lag field Typing has, in seconds — negative to send the bar in ahead of the text, positive to let the text land first. Both presets default to zero, arriving together; Typing keeps its 0.1s head start, since a bar that arrives with the first character reads as lagging it.',
      'The Bars Match the Static Background Exactly: an animated bar is measured to the glyph box — the same ascent-to-descent strip the layer paints with the toggle off — so nothing shifts or resizes when the animation finishes. Reveal\'s masks and Pop\'s words are laid out as blocks and would otherwise have reported the full line box, leaving every bar a few pixels too tall on any leading above 1.',
      'Hover a Canvas\'s Own Preview Link to Play It: with hover preview armed, pointing at the "Preview" link under any canvas plays that one canvas through all its frames, in place. Nothing else moves — the camera, the zoom, the panels and the other canvases stay exactly as they are, and the ad simply starts running inside its own frame. Pointing at "Full preview" still plays every canvas at once, as before.',
      'Shift+Scroll Now Nudges Every Number Field in the App: hover any numeric field, hold Shift and roll the wheel to step the value — Shift+Alt for a 10× jump. It worked in the Properties panel only; it now covers the Frame Transition controls (Duration, Zoom From, Blur, Punch To), the canvas Width and Height, the Settings dialog (zoom step, snap distance, undo limit, autosave interval, ad size limit), the New Project and Project Settings size limits, the crop window\'s rotation, the colour picker\'s gradient angle and opacity, and the preview page\'s ad width, height and loop length. The step is the field\'s own increment, so seconds-based fields move by 0.1 and pixel fields by 1, and the value stays inside the field\'s limits. Adjusting a value this way still counts as one undo step however many notches you roll.',
      'Turning On a Text Background Now Sets Leading and Padding For It: ticking BG on a text layer sets T/B Pad to 0 and Leading to 1.3, so each line gets its own separate bar. Auto leading packs lines tightly enough that their backgrounds touch and merge into a single slab, which is rarely the intent. Unticking BG puts both back to their defaults — auto leading and 4px padding.',

      'The Cursor Slide Text Entrance: a new IN preset for text and buttons. A typing cursor appears first, holds a beat with a single blink, and the text then slides horizontally out of it — Reveal\'s masked motion turned sideways, with a visible cursor at the reveal edge. The cursor stands a touch taller than the text, sits clear of it rather than flush against the first letter, and leaves the moment the text settles rather than lingering over it.',
      'Slide Out By Block or By Line: the whole text can emerge at once from a single cursor spanning the block\'s full height, however many lines it runs to — or each line can take its turn, every line with its own cursor sized to that line. The cursors arrive one at a time, cascading down the block, then clear together in a single beat once the last line has landed, so the block finishes as one piece instead of trailing a column of cursors blinking out in sequence. Lines mean what you see, not just where you pressed Enter: a long line that wraps into four rows is four lines, each taking its own turn. The grouping is measured off the laid-out text itself, so it stays correct when a data-merge swap or an auto-resize re-wraps the copy.',
      'Center Out, or Hold Still: with "Center out" on, the text stays centered as it emerges — the cursor is pushed leftward while the text slides rightward, the two moving as one camera move, and the composition never lists to one side. Off, the cursor holds still at the left edge and the text simply streams out to its right. It applies in both modes; line by line, each line centers on its own row with its own cursor.',
      'Line by Line with Center Out Sets Its Cursors First: the two together change the opening beat. Every cursor appears at once, blinks together and holds, and only then do the lines slide out one after another. Centering parks each cursor at the middle of its own line until that line plays, so bringing them in one at a time would have them popping into view at scattered points down the block; arriving as a set reads as the whole shape being laid out before anything moves. Without centering the cursors all sit at the same left edge, where arriving one at a time is the point, so they still cascade.',
      'Text Backgrounds Travel With the Text: on a text layer with a background, the coloured block now rides the text out of the cursor instead of waiting on screen for it. Every other entrance lets the layer paint its own background, but here that block sits outside the cursor\'s mask — so it appeared in full, empty, before a word of text had arrived, and its per-line rectangles collapsed into one block-wide slab because the layer\'s span now holds a single sliding piece. The background is painted on the sliding strip instead: block by block it keeps one rectangle per wrapped line, and line by line each line carries its own. Backgrounds now sit exactly where they do at rest, to the pixel, in both modes.',
      'Pick the Cursor\'s Colour: the cursor has its own colour control, opening the same palette every other colour field uses, so it can carry a brand colour or sit back against the artwork. It defaults to white rather than matching the text, since the bar reads as a caret laid over the ad rather than as a piece of the type. Line by line, every line\'s cursor takes the colour together.',
      'Fade: an optional soft entry that fades the text in across the slide, off by default so the reveal edge stays crisp — the same choice Reveal makes. Buttons additionally keep their "Fade BG" control, so the chrome can arrive with the label.',
      'Fixed Auto-Sized Text Shrinking to Nothing with Cursor + Center Out: an auto-sized headline set to Cursor with "Center out" could render at a few pixels tall — legible only as a smudge. The auto-sizer picks the largest font whose text still fits the layer, and it measures that by asking the browser how wide the text\'s content runs. "Center out" parks the text half a width to the right until it plays, and a shifted element counts toward that width — so the measurement came back half again too wide no matter which font size was being tried, every size was judged not to fit, and the sizer fell back to its smallest. The parts that move during an entrance are now measured where they come to rest, so the font is chosen against the layout the viewer actually sees.',

      'Four New Frame Transitions: Parallax, Lift, Flip and Punch join the Frame Transition list, all built for a kinetic but composed corporate look rather than novelty. Parallax slides the incoming frame in at full speed while the outgoing one drifts back at a third of that and dims, so the two read as separate planes at different depths. Lift rides the incoming frame in over a soft contact shadow that dissolves as it lands, with the outgoing frame settling back and dimming behind it — the card-stack move common to modern product interfaces. Flip turns the outgoing frame away edge-on and brings the next one around on the same axis, so the pair read as two faces of one card.',
      'Punch, for When a Frame Change Needs to Hit: the camera flies THROUGH the outgoing frame rather than cutting past it. The outgoing rushes up past the viewer, blurring out as it goes, while the next frame pulls into focus from further back. It is the highest-energy transition in the set and the only one that moves both frames along the same axis as the viewer. Punch To (105-400%) sets how hard the outgoing flies at you and Blur (0-60px) sets the peak defocus on both frames. How far back the incoming frame starts is derived from Punch To rather than set separately — the harder the punch, the deeper the next frame sits — so the two halves always read as one camera move instead of two unrelated scales.',
      'Frame Moves Now Travel on a Proper Easing Curve: Slide, Push, Swipe, Split, Iris, Corner Fold, Lift and Parallax all share one house curve — a pronounced symmetric S that builds out of rest, sweeps through the middle and decelerates into place. Most of them previously ran on the browser\'s generic "ease", which starts at nearly full speed: the frame covered most of its travel in the first fraction of the duration and then crept the remainder, which reads as a snap followed by a drift rather than as motion. They now accelerate from a standstill and settle, and because all eight share the curve, a set mixing them holds one rhythm. Flip keeps its own ease-in-out through the turn, and Punch keeps its harder accelerate-out-of-the-old-frame curve.',
      'The Curve Reaches the Two Presets That Cannot Use One: a couple of transitions do not move along a curve at all — their shape is drawn step by step into the animation, and a curve would be re-applied to every single step, stalling at both ends of each and juddering the result. The RMIT Pixel iris is one, and it now has the house curve worked into those steps directly, so it tracks the Circle and Square iris exactly despite getting there a completely different way. Bounce is the other, and it is deliberately left alone: its rebound predates the house curve and rewriting it would change ads already out in the world, so ticking Bounce on a Slide or Push looks precisely as it always has.',
      'Direction and Fade Where They Belong: Parallax, Lift and Flip take the full Direction control, including the dynamic Short edge / Long edge choices, so a transition set once follows the shape of each canvas in a size set. Punch is centred and has no direction. Parallax and Lift start with Fade off, since both already read as one solid card moving over another and cross-fading on top of that only greys the two together; the Fade toggle is still there. Flip and Punch have no Fade control at all — Flip\'s turn already hides the swap, and Punch needs its own opacity curve for the cross-zoom to read.',
      'The Transition Panel Now Names Its Frame: the heading reads "FRAME 2 TRANSITION" rather than just "FRAME TRANSITION", and hovering it confirms the transition plays as that frame arrives on screen. A transition belongs to the frame it brings on, but with the panel showing whichever frame is active it was too easy to read it as one setting for the whole ad and then wonder why it only played once.',
      'Fixed Switching Between Corner Fold and an Edge Transition Producing a Dead Cut: Corner Fold works in corners (Bottom-Right, Top-Left and so on) while every other transition works in edges (Left, Up and so on). Switching from Corner Fold to Slide, Push, Swipe or Split left the direction still holding a corner, which none of those presets can resolve — so the frame simply cut instead of moving, and the dropdown showed "Left" while the setting said otherwise. Switching between the two families now replaces the direction with a valid one for the preset you picked.',

      'Fixed the All-Versions Validator Failing Ads That Are Actually Under the Limit: with Dynamic Data versions in play, the batch validator reported filesizes well above the real ones and flagged versions that export comfortably under the 150KB limit. It was measuring the wrong thing — the raw, uncompressed HTML string with every image still embedded as base64 text, instead of the finished zip. Base64 adds roughly a third to an image\'s size, and none of it had been through the zip\'s DEFLATE compression, so the number ran several times higher than the file that actually ships (over three times on our test project). The validator now builds a real zip per version, exactly the way the export does, and reports that. Sizing is also no longer duplicated: the export panel, the batch WebP scan and this validator all call one shared routine, so the three can no longer drift apart again.',

      'Fixed the Jump Cut When Zooming to a Canvas: clicking a canvas in the Canvases panel, or double-clicking a canvas\'s size label, snapped the view to an unrelated part of the board for an instant and then slid from there to the canvas. The cause was ordering: the zoom level was applied and the board redrawn first, while the scroll position still held the offsets that belonged to the OLD zoom — so the first painted frame showed the board at the new scale looking at the wrong place, and only then did a smooth scroll correct it. Zoom and scroll are now interpolated together in a single pass, using the same routine Full preview already used for its zoom-to-fit, so the view travels straight to the canvas with nothing in between.',

A browser only reports a double-click when both clicks land on the same element, so the second one landed on the replacement and the event was never dispatched. The double-click is now recognised from the two presses directly, keyed on the canvas rather than the DOM node, so it survives the redraw. It activates the canvas and zooms it to fit, matching a click in the Canvases panel to the pixel.

Diagonal rather than width or height alone because banner sets change aspect wildly — 300x250 to 728x90 is far wider and much shorter, and either axis on its own gives a nonsense factor.

Selecting a pair and adding it to an existing image group now links the image and skips the mask, telling you why and pointing at Auto-Link or Create New Group, which give each half its own group. The same check blocks adding any layer to a group of the wrong kind. Legitimate linking is untouched: a mask can still join an unrelated group of shapes.',
      'Link a Whole Mask Group at Once: selecting a mask group — the mask plus the image it clips, which is what clicking the pair gives you — now offers Link Group like anything else. Because a link group holds one kind of layer, the pair becomes TWO groups working side by side: one for the images, one for the masks, each with settings that suit what it is. Auto-Link and Create New Group both do this in one step (a new group named "Hero" becomes "Hero (Image)" and "Hero (Mask)"). Conflicts that this could have caused are handled: width and height stay per-canvas on BOTH halves, so a mask can never end up sized for a different banner than the picture it clips; the two groups never bleed into one another, so a mask is never handed a picture and an image never becomes a mask; each canvas keeps its own mask pairing; and Live Linking, Push Changes and Remove Link now act on both groups together instead of only the half you happened to click. "Link to: <existing group>" is intentionally not offered for a pair, since it could only ever attach one half.',
      'Mask Layers Can Now Join Link Groups: previously only the masked image could be linked — right-clicking the mask itself offered no Link Group menu at all, so a mask\'s animation had to be set by hand on every size. Masks are shapes like any other and the underlying system always supported them; only the menu was withholding it. Right-click a mask and use Link Group as usual. One deliberate difference: Transform (width and height) starts switched off for a mask, because a mask\'s size belongs to the image it clips on its own canvas and Auto-Resize realigns it there — copying one canvas\'s dimensions onto every size would distort the clip. Tick it in the Link Groups panel if you do want sizes locked together. Auto-Link also pairs masks only with other masks now, never with an ordinary shape that happens to share the same name.',
      'Drop an Image Straight Onto the Properties Panel Preview to Replace It: with an image selected — or a mask group, where the panel already shows the masked image — you can now drag an image file from your computer, or an image out of the Assets panel, onto the preview thumbnail to swap the picture. No need to open Browse. The preview announces itself while you drag over it: a dashed accent frame, a glow, and a "Drop to replace image" label. Everything downstream is identical to using the Browse button, deliberately: a picture bound to a data column still updates that version\'s cell rather than the template default, Data lock still refuses (the preview simply isn\'t a drop target while locked), the fixed RMIT logo still can\'t be swapped, and a live-linked group still pushes the new picture to its siblings on the other canvases. With Live-link off it stays local, exactly as before — use Push changes to group.',
      'Fixed a Missing Selection Box on a Layer Left Alone in Its Group: selecting it moved and resized it normally, but no outline or resize handles were drawn, so it was hard to tell it was selected at all. It showed up right after deleting a masked image, because the mask keeps the group it was auto-grouped into, leaving a group with a single member — clicking it selected the group, and a group selection is tracked differently from clicking one layer on its own. The canvas only drew an outline for a group of two or more, or for a single layer selected on its own, so a group of exactly one fell between the two and got nothing. Any selection of one layer now draws its box and handles however it was selected.',
      'The Read-Only RMIT Asset Folder Now Says So, and Stops Pretending Anything Can Be Dropped: it carries a small padlock next to its name, and dragging something over it no longer lights it up as a drop target — it never accepted assets, so the highlight was promising something that always ended in a warning. Going further: as soon as you start dragging an asset OUT of that folder, the Assets panel stops showing any drop affordance at all — no panel tint, no folder highlight — because those assets can\'t be moved anywhere, and the cursor now shows it as not-allowed instead of inviting a drop. The canvas still shows its drop target as normal, so placing RMIT artwork on a banner is unchanged. Dragging assets from ordinary folders, and dropping files in from your computer, both behave exactly as before.',
      'The Workspace No Longer Scrolls Itself While You Drag an Image In: hovering near the edge of the canvas area used to make the whole board slide away under the cursor, so you would drop onto the wrong place.

      'Deleting a Masked Image Now Returns Its Mask to a Normal Shape: previously the mask shape stayed a mask — invisible, effectively impossible to select on the canvas, yet still listed in the Layers panel. The reason it only happened sometimes: a mask decided it was still valid simply because SOME image sat directly beneath it, so when you deleted the picture it was clipping, it silently adopted whichever image slid underneath — almost always the background, which nearly every ad has. So the mask survived, hidden, now clipping the wrong picture. Masks now remember which image they clip and turn back into an ordinary, visible, selectable shape when that image is deleted, and the background it wrongly grabbed is left alone. The [mask] tag disappears from the Layers panel at the same time. Masks in existing projects pick this up automatically the first time the project is drawn.',

Masking had nothing to do with it, which is why removing the mask didn\'t help either. When a version is active, a bound picture shows that ROW\'s image; the element\'s own picture is only the template default, which nothing is displaying at that moment. The drop was writing the template default, so the change was real but invisible. Dropping now updates the active version\'s image, exactly as the Replace image button in the properties panel already did, and your template default is left alone.

Previously the drop was simply ignored and you had to unmask the shape, swap the photo, then re-apply the mask. The cause: a mask shape sits directly on top of the image it clips and stays clickable so you can still move and resize it, so a drop aimed at the visible masked photo landed on the shape instead, and a shape isn\'t something a photo can replace. Adflow now looks through to the image underneath. The mask, its position and its size are all left untouched — only the photo changes. Dragging one image on the canvas onto a masked one works the same way, and an image can\'t be dropped onto its own mask to replace itself.'

The cause was caching: project files were stored with a one-hour cache lifetime, and because an in-place save reuses the same file path, reads kept being served the older copy. Project files are now stored no-cache and every read bypasses the cache, so a save is always what you get back.

Previously most of the board was empty space, so it was easy to scroll off into the void and lose sight of your work. There\'s now a sensible work area with room to the side and below for temporarily parking elements while you design. Existing projects are automatically re-homed onto the smaller board when opened, so nothing is lost or clipped.'

The width is a hard floor (below 1366 the interface can\'t lay out without clipping); the height floor is forgiving because real 1366×768 monitors only leave ~600–660px of viewport once the browser and OS chrome are accounted for.',

The canvas area now shrinks to fit between the two side panels (instead of pushing the right panel off-screen), and the topbar spacing was tightened so the Preview and Export buttons stay fully reachable.

      'Mask system revamp: replaced SVG `<mask>` + CSS `mask: url(#…)` with CSS `clip-path` using inline shape functions.

Every "mask + image invisible on another browser" report was traced to that one fragment-URL path.',

Adflow\'s three mask types map cleanly: `rect` (rounded) → `inset() round`; `circle`/`ellipse` → `ellipse()`; `pixel` (brand shape) → `path()` with the source path transformed into the image\'s local coord space. Rotation handled via 4-corner polygon for rect, 36-point polygon for non-circular ellipse, and absolute-coord L/C commands for the rotated pixel path.',
